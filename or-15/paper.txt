### **Session Type**
* Presentation

### **Abstract**
As a research data repository, Databrary focuses specifically on the storage, discoverability, and sharing of video-based datasets within the behavioral sciences. Storing video presents its own unique opportunities and challenges, the latter of which include research subject privacy and difficulties in creating and storing metadata that comes from different research projects in a standardized fashion. Databrary has implemented policies and practices within a functioning web application that meets both the needs of researchers as well as the preservation and access needs to share these datasets into the future. The lessons learned thus far in developing Databrary stand to model a viable approach to establishing practices and workflows for gathering and organizing research data that lift the burden off of researchers and also have potential to feed into established library systems for broader findability and accessibility.

### Background
Databrary[1] is a research data repository, developed with federal funding from the NSF and NIH, and hosted at New York University. It is being developed for the purpose of storing, sharing, and reusing data created by researchers in the developmental and learning sciences. Databrary was designed not only for the deposit of fully collected datasets, but also for the active uploading and management of datasets that are in the process of being collected and analyzed.

Observing and analyzing behavior are fundamental activities in the developmental and learning sciences, and researchers expend considerable resources collecting observations. The prevalent method for recording behavior is video, thus constituting the primary form of raw data for behavioral researchers. Although collecting videos is a widespread practice, video data sharing is virtually non-existent among researchers. The two primary impediments to sharing are the lack of tools that allow easy video data sharing and a long-standing tradition of conducting research in the isolation of individual laboratories. As a result, countless hours of video data waste away on tapes and hard drives in laboratories all over the world. 

The unique promise of video data arises from the nature of video and its propensity for reuse. In contrast to other forms of behavioral data, video is largely self-documenting, making data provenance a relatively minor issue. Moreover, because video captures much of the richness and complexity of behavior, videos can be used for many purposes — including those never imagined by the original researcher, making it inherently valuable for purposes of reuse and re-analysis. By sharing video data, other researchers can reuse the data to ask new questions, assess previous interpretations, learn about methods and procedures, draw ideas and inspiration for new lines of research, and show excerpts for educational purposes in teaching.

####1. Describing The Project
Since beginning work in early 2013, the goals of the Databrary project have been to: build a web-based library and infrastructure for storing and sharing video and associated metadata; provide tools for organizing and managing data; create a policy framework to permit sharing of identifiable data while appropriately restricting access; and grow a community of researchers committed to open video data sharing.

The website was opened for general use in October 2014 and has accepted contributions since earlier that year. It operates out of New York University (NYU) and works closely with NYU Libraries for storage and information system support. As of January 2015, it hosts 5700 video files totaling 1600 hours of recordings along with 2200 additional files. These files comprise 2400 sessions and are covered by 1300 records (including 1100 individual participants). Data originates from 35 individual contributors across 25 different universities.

Databrary is built in Scala on the Play Framework[2] to enable a responsive user interface, a complete API, and high-performance streaming. Recordings and other files are placed in content-based filesystem storage, and all structured data are stored in a PostgreSQL database, leveraging its geometric indexing capabilities for temporal data. All uploaded recordings are automatically transcoded to a standard format to enable cross-platform HTML5-based streaming and downloading for off-line access, currently H.264/AAC in an MPEG-4 container for video. This transcoding utilizes the high performance computing cluster at the hosting campus of NYU, using ffmpeg's libav bindings for both this and direct access to video frames and clips. The user interface is built primarily on the Angular web framework[3], and all data access is performed through an open JSON API. Although hosted data are protected, all source code is released under a GPLv3 license on github[4].

####2. Notable Challenges
**a.** ACCESS AND PRIVACY -
Conceptualizing a shared repository for video data sharing is not without its difficulties. For one, it poses special ethical challenges. Video often depicts participants’ faces, and their names are often spoken aloud. Because of this, sharing video data presents challenges related to participants’ privacy. In contrast to other forms of behavioral data which are non-identifiable or can be easily de-identified, video data cannot be easily de-identified without significantly diminishing its value and richness. Therefore, any solution for video sharing must also provide appropriate policy and access frameworks to ensure appropriate protection of research participants.

**b.** METADATA CREATION / CURATION -
Video data also provides challenges for data indexing and discovery efforts. While video data might be self-documenting, it is not self-describing from a metadata perspective. While watching through hours of collected videos may be enlightening, it is not always an effective use of research time. To facilitate the reuse of video data, researchers must also be able to find aspects of that data relevant to their interests without having to comb through hours of it themselves.

Additionally, researchers may have already collected and generated metadata about videos, including information about recorded sessions (including date and location), research participants (often including demographic information), and study manipulations (such as different groups or conditions). They also often score, transcribe, or tag video at smaller scales, from frames to minutes, using desktop software or other manual approaches. This metadata may not follow a set standard across laboratories, so one of the additional challenges in promoting a standard repository for these data is in creating a set of workflows by which heterogeneous datasets might be stored and accessed through a more common practice.

####3. Addressing these challenges and going forward
The first challenge for the Databrary project was defining a set of policies and an end-user design to enact and communicate the many challenges researches face in sharing the raw data of their studies while also protecting their subjects' privacy. Through a number of interviews and website interface iterations, we were able to design a set of agreements and workflows that allow researchers to accept the terms of the Databrary project, in language they understand, in such a way that also meets the requirements of their local IRB. While this might challenge the definition of open data defined universally by the Open Knowledge Foundation[5], striking the balance between allowing as much sharing as possible, while also garnering the trust and approval of our data contributors has been the key to growing our community and, in turn, the number of datasets in the repository.

The second challenge we continue to address is the curation process for the management and creation of metadata. We found that it is a challenge for researchers to reorganize and redescribe their data for the purposes of contributing their data to Databrary. For this, we have developed an in-house process for curating and incorporating datasets into Databrary that involves staff creating, cleaning, and enriching metadata, as well as clipping out identifying information from video data. To complement the manual curation process, we have also devised an end-user workflow for researchers to add their data to Databrary as they proceed with their research, which greatly reduces staff time in curation as well as promotes a standard data management practice across labs.

While we continue to elaborate and refine these processes, we also look towards the next steps of enhancing data discoverability, both within Databrary and beyond by increasing interoperability with existing library systems. By developing more in-depth search and browse features, providing a more refined API and API documentation, and exporting data in library-based metadata schemas to reach OAI-PMH compliance, we expect to ensure that the data in Databrary might connect to other research data repositories and be more findable and accessible across domain and institutional boundaries.

### **Conclusion**
As an innovative approach to a research data repositories, Databrary seeks to meet the needs of researchers through the data management needs of their studies. In doing so, it creates a unique opportunity to standardize the language and practices by which behavioral science researchers work with and share large amounts of video data. With long term preservation and storage in mind, Databrary is also in a potentially unique position to model how research data repositories can connect to a larger network of research data services across academic departments and institutions.
