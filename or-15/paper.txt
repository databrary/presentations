### Background
Databrary is a research data repository that has been developed for the purpos of storing, sharing, and reusing data created by researches in the field of developmental science. By working around this discipline and with specifically video data, Databrary is designed with not only managing fully collected datasets, but also through a front-end feature for researchers to Upload video data as they go, making Databrary both a repository and a tool for ongoing data management.

### **Presentation content**
Observing and analyzing behavior are fundamental activities in developmental science,
and researchers expend considerable resources collecting behavioral observations. By
far, the prevalent method for recording behavior is video, thus constituting the primary
form of raw data in developmental science. Although collecting videos is a widespread
and expensive practice, video data sharing is virtually non-existent. Typically, after an
original study is completed, video recordings are filed away or destroyed. The two
primary impediments to sharing are the lack of tools that allow easy video data sharing
and a long-standing tradition of conducting research in the isolation of individual
laboratories. As a result, countless hours of video data waste away on tapes and hard
drives in laboratories all over the world.

Video data sharing has both unique promise and special challenges. The unique
promise arises from the nature of video and its propensity for reuse. In contrast to other
forms of behavioral data, video is largely self-documenting, making data provenance a
relatively minor issue. Moreover, because video captures much of the richness and
complexity of behavior, videos can be used for many purposes—including those never
imagined by the original researcher. By sharing video data, other researchers can reuse
the data to ask new questions, assess previous interpretations, learn about methods
and procedures, draw ideas and inspiration for new lines of research, and show
excerpts for educational purposes in teaching.

Video data sharing also poses special ethical challenges. Video often depicts
participants’ faces, and their names are often spoken aloud. Because of this, sharing
video data presents ethical challenges related to participants’ privacy. In contrast to
other forms of behavioral data which are non-identifiable or can be easily de-identified,
video data cannot be easily de-identified without significantly diminishing its value and
richness. Therefore, any solution for video sharing must also provide appropriate policy
and access frameworks to ensure appropriate protection of research participants.

Video data also provides challenges for data indexing and discovery efforts. While
watching through hours of collected videos may sometimes be enlightening, for shared
video data to be most useful for reuse, researchers must also be able to find data
relevant to their interests. Basic descriptions of collected datasets provide a simple
index target, but may still cover hundreds of hours of video. Automated video analysis
and tagging is an active but immature research area, and does not yet provide general
solutions for arbitrary video data. However, researchers already collect and generate
metadata about videos, including information about sessions (including date and
location), research participants (often including demographic information), and study
manipulations (such as different groups or conditions). They also often score,
transcribe, or tag video at smaller scales, from frames to minutes. By encouraging and
enabling researchers to follow standard conventions for these annotations, without
interfering with the types of metadata they use or how they analyze it, videos can be
more easily discovered and re-purposed.

Video data sharing provides the potential to increase scientific transparency, accelerate
the pace of discovery, capitalize on previous research investments, and preserve video
data for generations to come. The Databrary project aims to exploit the promises of
video data sharing and address the ethical challenges of sharing identifiable data in
order to transform the culture of developmental science and build a community which
embraces data sharing and values transparency. To accomplish this, the project must:
build a web-based library and infrastructure for storing and sharing video and
associated metadata; provide tools for organizing and managing data; create a policy
framework to permit sharing of identifiable data while appropriately restricting access;
and grow a community of researchers committed to open video data sharing.

This paper will describe the current status of the Databrary project. We will address
recent community-building efforts and development progress, the cultural, policy, and
technical challenges that must be addressed, and the unique opportunities that this
project presents if the challenges are to be met effectively.
