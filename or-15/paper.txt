### **Abstract**
As a research data repository, Databrary seeks to focus specifically on the storage, discoverability, and sharing of video-based datasets within the behavioral sciences. Storing video presents its own unique opportunities and challenges, the latter of which include research subject privacy and difficulties in creating and storing metadata that comes from different research projects in a standardized fashion. Databrary has implemented policies and practices within a functioning web application that meets both the needs of researchers actively conducting their studies as well as the preservation and access needs to share these datasets into the future. The lessons that have been learned thus far in developing Databrary stand to model a viable approach to established practices and workflows for gathering and organizing research data in a fashion that lifts the burden off of researchers and also has implication for tying these workflows into established library systems for broader findability and accessibility across domains and institutions.

### Background
Observing and analyzing behavior are fundamental activities in developmental science, and researchers expend considerable resources collecting behavioral observations. By far, the prevalent method for recording behavior is video, thus constituting the primary form of raw data in developmental science. Although collecting videos is a widespread and expensive practice, video data sharing is virtually non-existent within this discipline. Typically, after an original study is completed, video recordings are filed away or destroyed. The two primary impediments to sharing are the lack of tools that allow easy video data sharing and a long-standing tradition of conducting research in the isolation of individual laboratories. As a result, countless hours of video data waste away on tapes and hard drives in laboratories all over the world. 

Databrary[1] is a research data repository grant-funded by the NSF and NIH and is hosted at New York University. It is being developed for the purpose of storing, sharing, and reusing data created by researches in the field of Behavioral Science. That data is largely video-based and so the repository is designed with those media in mind. Databrary was designed not only for the deposit of fully collected datasets, but for the active uploading and management of datasets that are in the process of being collected and analyzed. With reference to the discussion of the future of data repositories in the realm of academic research, Databrary offers a model for how to store large, complex, and sometimes heterogeneous datasets in such a way as to be available for current research data lifecycle management as well as later discoverability and reuse.

#THE PROJECT
Video data sharing provides the potential to increase scientific transparency, accelerate the pace of discovery, capitalize on previous research investments, and preserve video data for generations to come. The Databrary project aims to exploit the promises of video data sharing and address the ethical challenges of sharing identifiable data in order to transform the culture of developmental science and build a community which embraces data sharing and values transparency. To accomplish this, the project must: build a web-based library and infrastructure for storing and sharing video and associated metadata; provide tools for organizing and managing data; create a policy framework to permit sharing of identifiable data while appropriately restricting access; and grow a community of researchers committed to open video data sharing.

The Databrary website was opened for general use in October 2014 and has accepted contributions since earlier that year. It operates out of NYU's Institute of Human Development and Social Change at the Steinhardt School and works closely with NYU Libraries for storage and information system support. It currently hosts 5700 video files totaling 1600 hours of recordings along with 2200 additional files. These files comprise 2400 sessions and are covered by 1300 records (including 1100 individual participants). Data originates from 35 individual contributors across 25 different universities.

Databrary is built in the spirt of open source and uses open source frameworks and libraries for its infrastructure. It is built in Scala on the Play Framework[2] to enable a responsive user interface, a complete API, and high-performance streaming. Recordings and other files are placed in content-based filesystem storage, and all structured data are stored in a PostgreSQL database, leveraging its geometric indexing capabilities for temporal data. All uploaded recordings are automatically transcoded to a standard format to enable cross-platform HTML5-based streaming and downloading for off-line access, currently H.264/AAC in an MPEG-4 container for video. This transcoding utilizes the high performance computing cluster at the hosting campus of New York University, using ffmpeg's libav bindings for both this and direct access to video frames and clips. The user interface is built primarily on the Angular web framework[3], and all data access is performed through an open JSON API. Although hosted data are protected, all source code is released under a GPLv3 license on github[4].

#THE OPPORTUNITY
At a perceived crossroads in the collection and sharing of scientific data, video data is a ripe area for developing the future of digital repositories and libraries. In designing a set of technologies and practices for creating and managing a video data repository, there are both unique promise and special challenges that highlight this. The unique promise of video data arises from the nature of video and its propensity for reuse. In contrast to other forms of behavioral data, video is largely self-documenting, making data provenance a relatively minor issue. Moreover, because video captures much of the richness and complexity of behavior, videos can be used for many purposes — including those never imagined by the original researcher, making it inherently valuable for purposes of reuse and re-analysis. By sharing video data, other researchers can reuse the data to ask new questions, assess previous interpretations, learn about methods and procedures, draw ideas and inspiration for new lines of research, and show excerpts for educational purposes in teaching.

#CHALLENGES
##ACCESS AND PRIVACY
Though conceptualizing a shared repository for video data sharing is not without its difficulties. For one, it poses special ethical challenges. Video often depicts participants’ faces, and their names are often spoken aloud. Because of this, sharing video data presents challenges related to participants’ privacy. In contrast to other forms of behavioral data which are non-identifiable or can be easily de-identified, video data cannot be easily de-identified without significantly diminishing its value and richness. Therefore, any solution for video sharing must also provide appropriate policy and access frameworks to ensure appropriate protection of research participants.

##METADATA CREATION / CURATION
Video data also provides challenges for data indexing and discovery efforts. While video data might be self documenting, it is not self describing from a metadata perspective. Sure watching through hours of collected videos may sometimes be enlightening. But, to facilitate the reuse of video data, researchers must also be able to find aspects of that data relevant to their interests without having to comb through hours of it themselves. Basic descriptions of collected datasets provide a simple index target, but may still cover hundreds of hours of video, not facilitating quick ways to drill down into the specific parts of video data a researcher might need. Automated video analysis and tagging is an active but immature research area, and does not yet provide general solutions for arbitrary video data. 

However, researchers may have already collected and generated metadata about videos, including information about recorded sessions (including date and location), research participants (often including demographic information), and study manipulations (such as different groups or conditions). They also often score, transcribe, or tag video at smaller scales, from frames to minutes, using desktop software or other manual approaches. Though this metadata may not follow a set standard across laboratories. And so one of the additional challenges in promoting a standard repository for these data is in creating a set of work-flows by which heterogeneous datasets might be stored and accessed by a common practice. 

By encouraging and enabling researchers to follow standard conventions for these annotations, without interfering with the types of metadata they use or how they analyze it, videos can be more easily discovered and re-purposed. 

#DATABRARY'S APPROACH AND LESSONS LEARNED SO FAR

As a project that has been in operation for over a year, the Databrary has already tackled many of the challenges above.

The first challenge for the Databrary project was defining a set of policies and end-user design to enact and communicate the many challenges researches face in protecting their subjects privacy, while also wishing to share the raw data of their studies. Through a number of interviews and website interface iterations, we were able to design a set of agreements and workflows that allow researchers to accept the terms of the Databrary project, in language they understand, in such a way that also meets the requirements of their local IRB. 

The second challenge we continue to improve on is the curation process and the management and creation of metadata. We found that it is a challenge for researchers to reorganize and redescribe their data for the purposes of contributing their data to Databrary. For this, we have developed an in-house process for curating and incorporating datasets into Databrary that involve a non-trivial amount of staff time creating, cleaning, and enriching metadata, as well as clipping out identifying information from video data. On the other hand, we have also devised an end-user workflow for researchers to add their data to Databrary as the proceed with their researcher, which greatly reduces staff time in curation as well as promotes a standard data management practice across labs. 

While we continue to elaborate and refine these processes, we have already established a practice and tool that allows a number of researchers across the country to actively share their research data with their colleagues. Our current position as a flagship research data repository also gives way to opportunities for connecting these normalized datasets with a central repository through the library system. At the crossroads of research data management and open repositories, Databrary serves as a model for how to meet researchers needs locally, while providing a tool and set of practices that can allow shared data to be found and accessed more globally, both across different laboratories and institutions, perhaps a little further down the road, across disciplines. 

##Open?
As discussed above, one of the primary challenges in working with a platform to share video data that involves human research subjects is the priority place on respecting subject privacy. As such, while many datasets are shared with little restriction, some datasets are only shared with a specified group of users. In the interest of sharing of reuse of data, we learned early on in the community building process that seeding the  collection with data that others can see and access is key to the growth of the community and adoption of the platform. Though at the same time, trust that the plaform is secure and does not violate researcher's IRB agreements is also a large component of growing the community and for other researchers to adopt Databrary as a tool for working with their data and sharing it with other researchers. Striking that delicate balance, then, means that we have a distinct interest in being open, but that our definition of open is tailored to our community of users rather than a universal definition of open data as determined by, for example, the Open Knowledge Foundation[5]

### **Conclusion**
As an innovate approach to a research data repositories, Databrary seeks to meet the needs of researchers through the data management needs of their studies. In doing so, it creates a unique opportunity to standardize the language and practices with which developmental science researchers with large amounts of video data collect and share their data. With long term preservation and storage in mind - with the help of NYU Libraries - Databrary is also potentially be in a unique position to model how research data repositories can connect to the larger stream of aggregate research data service departments and research data access across departments and institutions.
