OR 2015 Slides Outline
======================

#0. Title, Introduction
  - 
#1. Front page screen
  - Databrary is a web-based video-data repository for developmental and learning sciences researchers
  - Today I will tell you about the project, including the reason for its existing, the challenges it aims to solve, how it approaches solving them (both through technology/data design and policy/community management. 

#2. A little background
  - when started
  - who's funding and for what purpose
  - small team situated in steinhardt with consulation and resources provided by NYU Libraries and ITS
  - general statistics so far

#3. The three main components to our approach (not just a technical solution)
  - Community
    - Outreach, growing the community, 
    - Policy framework for responsible sharing, 
    - Meeting the needs of data producers and data users
  - Service
    - Storing, Sharing, and reuse oriented
    - Web interface
    - Tools that make sense for researchers
    - Constructing a common workflow for sharing
  - Infrastructure
    - Storage, 
    - Working with video data
    - Metadata and ingest
 
#4. Community Challenges (how to promote sharing)
  - Creating the right policy framework for users to trust in
  - Building a community of people in the same field, so there is an implicit trust
  - Ensuring that the community is heterogenous enough to make reuse valuable
  - Communicating all this in simple language 

#5. Service challenges (how to support correct sharing)
  - Curation challenges (file or desk drawer data)
  - Creating tools that make sense for researchers to use

#6. The technical challenges (how to make sure everything is safe, secure, and well organized but also accessible)
  - Video data is large, cumbersome
  - It is also information rich, but not self-describing
  - Off the shelf solution or bespoke?
  - Standard technical solution to a non-standard process

#7. Policy Framework (community)
  - A unique and important contribution
  - Was one of the first challenges that needed to be addressed
  - Supports researchers and their IRB to feel confident contributing their human subject-centered research to databrary.

#8. Community outreach and support (community)
  - Sharing in this fashion is not the standard practice
  - Requires a good deal of time and effort helping researchers get authorized to use the system and help them understnd how to technically get their data uploaded
  - Changing the culture while supporting researchers in a practice that benefits them and helps them implement DMPs

#9. Support for getting data in - ingest (service)
  - Communication
  - Transfering files
  - Getting consents
  - Works in some cases, but not all
  - Big challenge, very time consuming

#10. Getting data in and accessing it - self-deposit (service)
  - Upload as you go
  - spreadsheet (image of spreadsheet)
    - suggested and auto-complete metadata
  - timeline (image of timeline)
    - annotation and syncing video
    - can sync videos
    - this is where you might do online coding of data
  - reflecting video access and permissions

#11. The data model (infrastucture)
  - What is our approach to representing a dataset (a study in general, might have a publication, might have grant funding)
  - DOIs and ORCID to support linking entities in other systems
  - Sessions
  - Records

#12. Storage and technical stack (infrastructure)
  - The web application
  - Open source
  - Storage - Libraries and ITS - Mirrored locations, administrative metadata?, preservation level integrity checks, redundant storage

#13. What we've achieved
  - A unique collaboration
  - Navigated the complicated policy barriers
  - Created and released a system that works

#14. Near term todos
  - More refined and faceted search
  - More linked data
  - DOIs for datasets
  - Support for audio files

#15. Long term todos
  - With a larger community and more datasets, becoming part of aggregate Library metadata systems
  - Creating more and better tools for researchers to actively work with their data in the browser (coding)

#16 Sustainability?
