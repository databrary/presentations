# Researcher-library collaborations: Data repositories as a service for researchers

###Keywords: Research data repositories, Data sharing, open science, Embedded librarians 

## Abstract

Libraries have long provided a home for a diverse range of scholarly products, but new interest has arisen in organizing, preserving, and sharing the raw materials -- the data and metadata -- that undergird the published products of research.
Library and information science professionals have valuable expertise to bring to bear in the effort to create larger, more diverse, and more widely used data repositories.
However, for libraries to be maximally successful in providing the research data management and preservation services required of a successful data repository, librarians must work especially closely with researchers and embed themselves in data management workflows as much as possible.
The Databrary project provides a model for how library and information science experts, working in a diverse team, can inform the development and implementation of a data repository that is closely linked to the needs of a specific scholarly community -- researchers who use video as a main source of data to study human development and learning.

## Background 

Databrary (Databrary, 2015a), is a repository for storing and sharing videos collected as raw data in the context of research about human development and learning.
The project has financial support from the National Science Foundation (BCS-1238599) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (U01-HD-076595-01).
New York University (NYU) hosts the library and its staff, with additional support from The Pennsylvania State University (PSU).
Databrary began accepting contributions in early 2014 and opened for general use in October 2014.
In less than a year of operation, the number of institutions with authorized users had grown to 40, with 79 individual investigators from North America, Europe, South America, and Australia.
As of March 2015, 35 individual contributors representing 25 different universities had contributed video data or excerpts.

From the outset, Databrary has been designed to meet researchers' needs, not as an isolated project initiated by the library or the central IT department.
Databrary has focused on a specific scholarly domain, the developmental and learning sciences, and on a particular data type -- video. 

Most researchers in the developmental and learning sciences collect video as raw data, but ethical and technical barriers to sharing video have made open data sharing uncommon.
While personally identifying information can be removed from text-based data, videos may contain faces, voices, names spoken aloud, and sometimes views of the homes of research participants.
These cannot be removed without reducing the information content.
Further, the collection of video or other identifiable or sensitive information requires approval by a research ethics board and informed consent from the participants.
The consent process formalizes a promise by the research team that a participant's identity will not be disclosed.
Thus, researchers risk violating participants’ privacy if digital images are viewed or released to others without authorization.

At the same time, video has significant potential for re-use.
Video uniquely captures the complexity and richness of behavior.
Accordingly, videos recorded in one experimental setting for one purpose may often be used by other investigators for different purposes.
As such, sharing video has large potential payoffs if researchers can trust that their data will be treated with the proper care.

To realize the promise of video data sharing, Databrary has learned to focus on reducing barriers and on forging community consensus.
Project innovations include the development of policies to enable sharing of identifiable data, the creation of technical infrastructure that implements secure sharing, easy citation of data and related materials, and the adoption of practices that encourage researchers to share what, with whom, and when they are most comfortable.

Beyond these elements, launching the repository has required Databrary to engage a wide range of expertise, including experts in the NYU Library and project staff with training in library and information science. 
That expertise has played a vital role.
By engaging researchers in a community committed to data sharing, Databrary has learned about the diverse curation requirements of datasets collected through very different lab processes, especially how to represent those datasets in a standard fashion for future access and re-use.
Accordingly, the Databrary project offers insights about ways libraries and librarians may engage with scholars in specific topical domains in order to serve emerging demands for sharing research data.

In this paper, we will discuss how Databrary has established itself as a data repository that works closely and frequently with researchers in a particular scholarly domain.
We will also show how Databrary has found solutions to many of the barriers that limit video sharing through close interaction with that target community. 
Finally, in laying out a roadmap for enhancements to Databrary, we suggest lessons library and information scientists might draw from the Databrary experience.

## Literature Review

Databrary has strong ties to the NYU library, but largely autonomous operations.
A sampling of the current literature on data repositories and data curation shows that these structural features fall well within established repository norms.
Some repositories capture research data across domains (Lyle, 2014; Witt, 2012), while others commit to a specific field of study (Peer & Green 2012; Ardini, Pan, Qin, & Cooley, 2013).
Creating and operating research data repositories pose many challenges, but how repositories are established within their host institutions and how they interface with content producers turn out to be critical.

Collaborations between libraries and research entities or content producers are common.
The collaboration between Purdue Library Systems and Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP) provides one example (Witt, 2012).
The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) provides another.
ICPSR emerged from the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan to encompass a consortium of institutional partners (Lyle, 2014).
An open data repository for the social sciences at Yale (Peer & Green, 2012) represents a collaboration between Yale’s Office of Digital Assets and Infrastructure (ODAI) and the Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS).
However, the literature provides modest detail about how these sorts of collaborations emerge or about which collaborators take the initiative.

In contrast, the literature on library practices and resposibilities describes how new policies and practices around communication with the scientific community have been critical to the success of some data respositories.
Purdue's Data Curation Center (DCC), for example, has developed a process for interviewing researchers about their data curation needs in contributing to data repositories; library staff need to understand how to conduct these interviews (Carlson, 2012).
Carlson (2012) finds that without the right kind of communication with researchers, "services that do not align with real-world needs of researchers will not be used."
Librarians, with their strengths in metadata creation and standardization across domains, can help reduce the barriers to sharing that often plague the dissemination of data, particularly where research cultures differ drastically across domains (MacMillian, 2014).
Not only does a librarian working with researchers help in building a better repository, but a librarian whose role is embedded in and informed by working with researchers can ensure better material description and documentation.
This results in more productive research outcomes (Federer, 2013).
Some predict that the role of liaison librarians in data repository building will increase: Researchers will welcome assistance in reducing the burden of describing and preparing data for preservation, and this will convince more researchers to contribute data (McClure, Level, Cranston,Oehlerts, & Culbertson, 2014). The Databrary team's experiences working with investigators to curate archival data bear out these predictions.

New practices for managing workflows involving technology and metadata creation will be needed to develop successful data repositories.
Research data includes diverse materials related to scholarly process and scholarly products.
This means that research data differ from other products of research such as journal articles and books, and it raises questions about how libraries should respond.
How should libraries represent datasets in a manner that allows them to be cataloged, preserved, and cited (Wickett, Sacchi, Dubin, & Renear, 2012; Hourclé, 2008)? Representing research data outside of its original context risks making the data more difficult to interpret (Borgman, 2012).
Can libraries meet the needs of researchers who are increasingly held responsible for documenting and sharing the raw data from their research along with its products and derivatives (Heidorn, 2011; Greenberg, White, Carrier, & Scherle, 2009)? 
Propagating research data is fast becoming a core component of scientific communication, but a bridge between researchers and repository staff must be built to facilitate that propagation (Castelli, Manghi, & Thanos, 2013).
A survey of repository staff workers in Australia and New Zealand illustrates some of the challenges ahead. 
It found that building digital data repositories will require library workers to develop new skills related to the software driving these repositories and skills to communicate with IT departments (Simons & Richardson, 2012).
Library staff will also need to develop working knowledge about semantic web-based metadata schema like RDF, multimedia file formats, and access concerns like copyright legislation and open access standards (Simons & Richardson, 2012).
The Databrary project team's experience echos many of these points. Staff without library or information science backgrounds have had to learn about curation, preservation, and metadata, and staff with library science backgrounds have had to acquire a range of new technical skills common in software development.

## Description of services

Databrary's core competencies are a focus on community outreach and the provision of services for scholarly communication, support from institutional partners, services for data curation developed with the guidance of information professionals, and a strong technical infrastructure. 
We discuss each of these in turn.

### Community Outreach and Scholarly Communication

From the outset, Databrary has sought to connect with the research community in a meaningful way, in part by hiring staff who understand both the professional needs of researchers and the requirements for preserving and facilitating access to information.
Early on, the project team came to understand that researchers were more likely to share video data with colleagues who were part of the same scholarly community -- people who held the same understanding about the sensitivities involved in sharing identifiable data related to children and families.
At the same time, the team understood that it would have to change prevailing sentiments in the developmental science community about the feasbility of sharing video data openly and bring knowledge about data curation and preservation practices to researchers largely unfamiliar with these topics.
This led to a decision to hire a staff member with specific responsibilities for community outreach and to the hiring of a staff member with experience in library and information science.
These team members and our technical staff interact directly with researchers, providing hands-on support at every stage of the researcher's interactions with Databrary.
Staff assist with initial user registration, consult with research ethics boards, and manage data curation (see Curation below).
The Databrary team actively seeks out new potential contributors and datasets, and the team has established partnerships with some of the main scholarly associations in the developmental and learning sciences: the Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD), the International Society on Infant Studies (ISIS), the Cognitive Development Society (CDS), and the American Educational Research Association (AERA).

Databrary has also attempted to forge a consensus on professional values concerning the questions of what materials to share, when in the research life cycle should materials be shared, who should share, and how one should acknowledge the use of shared data and other materials.
A Data Sharing Manifesto (Databrary, 2015b) articulates the project's philosophy.
It suggests that *all* researchers should share as much material as they are comfortable sharing and have permission to share; researchers should share as early on in the research life cycle as possible; and researchers should properly acknowledge all materials contributed by others that inform their research products.
To support proper citation behavior, Databrary provides valid uniform resource identifiers (URIs) in a standard format for datasets as a whole and for subcomponents within them. 
The system provides links to persistent identifiers for publications associated with a dataset, and persistent identifiers (DOIs) for hosted datasets.
Library and information science experts have been instrumental in shaping the design and implementation of these features.

Finally, through communication with researchers we learned about the link between data privacy, trust in the repository, and a potential contributor's support for open data sharing.
Databrary has had to create policies and technical systems to protect data privacy and establish trust.
Sharing identifiable research data requires that the Databrary system restrict access to materials on the basis of both the permissions granted by individual participants and on the level of sharing a researcher has granted.
Databrary offers several levels of permissions, allowing researchers to share data only with their own lab, in bi-lateral relationships with specific individual Databrary users, with the entire community of authorized Databrary researchers, or in limited cases, with the general public.
Because of this, Databrary staff work closely with data contributors to determine how a datasets original distribution restrictions, usually governed by a research ethics board (e.g., IRB), translate to Databrary's access levels. As such, privacy becomes a significant component in the curation process.

### Institutional Positioning

Databrary has established relations with a diverse "internal" community, as well. The project relies on several collaborations and partnerships within NYU.
These enable Databrary to navigate swiftly between the University Library and the community of researchers on campus and elsewhere.
The system's technical architecture is based on a hybrid model, developed initially by the NYU Libraries together with the central IT organization.
The Databrary web application uses central IT servers and storage.
The Libraries and central IT, in turn, guarantee the preservation of Databrary collections indefinitely, even if the project funding is interrupted.
This partnership requires that Databrary follow digitial preservation best practices, described further below.
This model is new for the Libraries and central IT, but it represents a desired direction for enhanced central support for research data repositories across the University.

Another significant partnership has been with the Office of Sponsored Programs.
Normally, this office does not work substantively with projects once funding has been received.
However, in the case of the Databrary project, this office has been an engaged participant, developing new policies and acting as a model university Authorized Organization Representative, a role that is critical in the legal and policy framework Databrary developed for sharing between institutions.
Similarly, the General Counsel's office, ordinarily a strictly administrative office that challenges or defends legal issues, has also been engaged developing the legal and policy framework for inter-institutional sharing.

A document called the Databrary Access Agreement enables inter-institutional sharing (Databrary, 2015c).
This agreement is signed by a university officer with authority to affirm the enforcement of research practices on behalf of an institution.
This is typically the director of an Office of Sponsored Programs.
Individual researchers at that institution may then be authorized by that officer to access and share data using Databrary.
Researchers agree to treat data from Databrary with the same standards of care and ethical concern that would apply to data they collect themselves, to respect the desired release preferences of people depicted in data they contribute to Databrary, and to supervise the use of Databrary materials by students or staff under their guidance.
The agreement permits both access to the data and, with ethics board approval, contributions.
To our knowledge, this combination of privileges makes the agreement novel, and like other aspects of the Databrary project, it emerged as a way to reduce barriers to sharing the team discovered in enaging with the target scholarly community.

By bringing together and creating collaborations among various administrative entities in new ways, Databrary has also influenced university administrative processes themselves.
These relationships were envisioned from the start, with the collaborating units participating in conversations even before proposal writing began.

### Curation

Of course, the main purpose of Databrary's community outreach efforts, internal partnerships, and policy framework is to secure data deposits.
Databrary supports after-the-fact and active curation.
After-the-fact curation consists of ingesting datasets after collection by researchers has been completed, typically after all study derivatives (research papers, analyses, etc.) have been created.
Active curation refers to Databrary's user interface that allows researchers to upload their video data and metadata as they collect it during the course of a study.

Every data repository faces the problem of defining a metadata schema that will accept a wide variety of datasets, while adding a level of standardization that allows deposits to be easily searched (Hourclé, 2008; Orchard, 2014).
The Databrary team learned early on that requiring only a minimal amount of metadata was preferable to making mandatory exhaustive data descriptions.
The latter burdens researchers, reducing their incentive to participate.
Moreover, the developmental and learning sciences community supports a diverse range of research topics, and with few exceptions, no common metadata ontologies have emerged.
As a result, Databrary chose to create a system that defines minimum requirements for metadata, but supports the addition of information beyond that minimum, after a dataset has been deposited.
This approach standardizes the internal representation of datasets from the outset while facilitating discovery and sharing.
We think it also lays a foundation for the emergence of stricter metadata standards as they achieve consensus within the user community.

#### After-the-fact curation 

Communication with researchers remains a key component in the curation of data they have already collected. This includes mostly video data from a study that completed recently, but also video data that had been collected many years or decades ago and has been stored archivally.
Databrary staff with expertise in library and information science discuss datasets with researchers planning on making contributions.
These discussions begin early in the curation process.
Regular communication with researchers helps the Databrary staff understand how target contributors envision the representation of their data inside the repository.
The discussions also inform the ongoing development of the metadata schema, ensuring that it continues to meet the diverse needs of a wide range of individual labs.

Since Databrary's model for seeking permission to share data is new, most data eligible for after-the-fact curation was gathered under a different set of provisions.
So, communication between Databrary staff and the researcher helps forge a mutual understanding about how to interpret pre-existing restrictions on the data in a way compatible with Databrary's policies and research ethics.
Indeed, access restrictions are themselves essential metadata.
Because access restrictions apply to the study level, session level (i.e. analytic units within studies), and individual file levels, gathering these metadata constitutes a non-trivial curation effort.
However, the problems enountered with and solved in curating each new dataset informs the process of curating new contributions.
Finally, embedded library staff and staff familiar with the practices and interpretation of data within the content domain collaborate to ensure the quality and organization of all ingested data.

Once a dataset has been approved for ingesting and the contributor has been authorized for access, staff begin the process of gathering, organizing, and preparing the data.
Occasionally, staff will review data for personal information Databrary does not wish to upload, such as residential addresses or Social Security numbers.
In the case of older video collections, where relevant metadata may have been lost or not documented to begin with, staff also review videos for any relevant metadata related to participant tasks or conditions.
In these circumstances, it helps to have staff with expertise in library science and in behavioral science work side by side.

Finally, once all the metadata has been organized into a set of comma-separated value (CSV) files, and video files have been uploaded to a staging server for ingest, a set of server scripts merge the metadata into a JSON file which is then uploaded via the web application.
This initiates the uploading of the video assets, the creation of research sessions and records, video transcoding into to a standard format, and clipping of video assets to remove identifying information where specified in the ingest script.
After upload, and the results stored on the long-term preservation location within NYU's ITS data centers.

#### Active curation

The curation of data well after its collection requires signficant resources.
Moreover, Databrary staff learned early on that many researchers balk at the prospect of preparing data for sharing once a study has ended.
Data sharing has few concrete rewards relative to other scholarly activities.
Thus, while providing expertise to assist with after-the-fact data curation reduces barriers to sharing, the time commitment required of the researcher remains a substantial deterrent. 
Further, Databrary's founders envisioned the site as more than a passive repository, but as an active community where users browse, comment on, excerpt, cite, modify, desposit, and reuse data.
Realizing this vision meant that Databrary needed to provide tools that would assist contributors in managing and preserving research data from early on in the research life cycle.
In order to be useful, data management through Databrary would have to reflect what we observed to be some of the common practices undertaken in collecting and keeping track of data through its lifecycle.

The team incorporated insights drawn from observations of common data management practices.
From them we created a set of data management features available in Databrary's user interface that empower researchers to *actively curate* their own projects -- to upload data with accompanying metadata -- as each study unfolds.
We have designed and implemented a spreadsheet interface (see Figure 1) for entering, editing, and viewing session-level metadata (e.g.
participants, conditions of study, tasks in the experiment, session access levels, study groups etc.).
Most researchers use desktop spreadsheets for precisely this purpose in their own labs, making the interface and functionality transparent.
We have also implemented a timeline for uploading, viewing, and tagging video assets related to sessions.
The timeline view is designed to look and operate like video editing software like that commonly used in many research labs (see Figure 2).
It allows users to upload and position video files to reflect the temporal order of each component of data collection and to annotate video sections with user-generated tags.
These tags become additional metadata indices for search and discovery.
Databrary's active curation features emerged from ongoing discussions with Databrary users and potential users, and we continue to refinine them on the basis of user feedback. 

INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE (Fabricius, 2014)

INSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE (Fabricius, 2014)

Active curation distinguishes Databrary from most repositories.
The decision to make active curation a priority emerged from Databrary's focus on reducing the barriers to data sharing faced by its target research field.
The decision to create a spreadsheet interface that focuses on sessions stems from an insight that the observational session is a basic analytic unit of behavioral science (Bakeman & Quera 2012).
Employing a timeline for the display and management of video assets draws inspiration from desktop coding tools like Datayu, Mangold Interact, and Noldus Observer, which many researchers in developmental science use to code videos for behaviors of interest.
Accordingly, achieving a deep familiarity with the practices of researchers in the target domain enabled Databrary staff to create a representational model for data that most researchers understand and a data management workflow similar to existing practices, but strengthened by being web-based.
Moreover, we anticipate that the use of a standard metadata tool will contribute to the harmonization of metadata tags and greater standardization of data management practices, including, as mentioned previously, the possibility of standardized ontologies.
If it works as intended, active curation will reduce significant barriers to sharing, and as a result, it will accelerate the pace of contributions and the growth in new investigators.

### Technical Infrastructure

Since many of the system requirements for Databrary were novel and specific to the particular target domain, the team opted to build a new application rather than adapt an existing tool.
The result is an open-source (Github, 2015) web application built in Scala on the Play Framework to support a responsive user interface, a complete application program interface (API), and high-performance streaming.
The backend is a PostgresSQL relational database.
The user interface is built primarily on the AngularJS JavaScript framework, and all data access is performed through an open JSON API.

NYU Libraries have played a critical role in advising the development team about storage and computing technologies available within the NYU IT system, and in helping negotiate access to and cost-models for IT services.
As part of the curation process, Databrary stores at least two versions of each item of Databrary video content: a copy for access, and the received original file if it was digital, or a 10-bit YUV digital preservation copy if the original version was not digital.
Currently, the access version format is H.264 (HiP) with AAC audio in an MPEG-4 container, although we expect the appropriate video formats to change over time, as has been the case with many digital video formats in recent years.
The system uses NYU's high performance computing (HPC) cluster to transcode videos in the background using ffmpeg.

For preservation, the original file (if digital) or the preservation copy will be stored in a long-term preservation repository managed jointly by the NYU Libraries and the central Information Technology Services (ITS) unit.
This repository ensures that each content item has a METS structural metadata file that associates the digital asset with its metadata.
It stores files in two mirrored and geographically distributed locations, and a third copy on offsite tape; it performs regular fixity checks; and it provides a format migration capacity, in the event that a stored format becomes at-risk of obsolescence.

## Next Steps

The Databrary team continues to build upon the lessons learned during the project's design and initial roll-out.
Priorities for the next several years include expanding the number and diversity of datasets, improving active/self-curation capabilities, enhancing features beyond storage and preservation, more extensive integration with other services, and planning for long-term sustainability.

### Expand number and diversity of datasets

<!-- I feel like this section is a little tangential -->
<!-- I don't feel especially strongly about this section, but I'd understood that digital video was a new frontier for libraries, at least where video as research data is concerned. So, we are breaking new ground and solving problems that may apply in other domains. -->
<!-- I tried reflecting that more in the section below, but if it still doesn't work, we might want to think about striking it.-->

At present, the materials stored in Databrary represent a relatively small number of research topics from a subset of investigators who already have data on hand with suitable permissions that permit widespread sharing.
However, as our approach has focused more generally on how researchers store and manage video data in a repository context, we anticipate that Databrary can apply its solutions across a broader set of domains as we meet the needs of researchers outside of the community we currently serve.   
With increasing numbers of researchers beginning to adapt research protocols to enable video data sharing like the Databrary access model, we anticipate that the number and diversity of datasets will grow.
The team has also identified a use case for Databrary materials that may accelerate the pace of contributions -- excerpts or clips for teaching.
Many developmental scientists already use excerpts to illustrate methods or key phenomena, and researchers widely share excerpts with one another on an informal *ad hoc* basis.
Databrary has begun to seek out contributions like this as a way to broaden the base of materials for viewing and to create easy ways for more researchers to contribute.
In a similar vein, Databrary encourages researchers who use computer-based displays in their work to share sample displays.
In this case, no research ethics questions stand in the way of sharing.
These additional use cases -- teaching and demonstrating methods or displays -- show the value of building a repository infrastructure focused on video.

Beyond these initiatives, Databrary plans to expand the scope of the library to encompass other scholarly domains.
Researchers in other fields of social, behavioral, and learning science -- education, cognitive and social psychology, sport science and kinesiology, ethology, anthropology, linguistics, communication sciences, and political science -- use video.
Databrary staff continue to cultivate partnerships with individual researchers and with professional societies representing new fields that employ video.
We find that conversations with researchers in different domains illustrate differences in curation and data management practices across fields.
As a result, staff continue to document and refine Databrary's curation processes in consultation with library and data services staff who have expertise in collection development and dataset profiles.

### Improve Active/Self-Curation

As the Databrary user community grows, we will refine and codify our curation and collection development processes.
The more datasets we see, the more we can refine our metadata schema to represent diverse datasets. 
In codifying our curation process, we will incorporate best practices like the Data Curation Profiles Toolkit and similar initiatives (McLure et al., 2014).
Our user interface for active curation is still new, so we plan to continue gathering feedback from users to improve the tools.
We aim to strike a balance between representing data as researchers want to represent it and maintaining a structure that makes information useful to and discoverable by others.

### Enhance Databrary's feature-set

With Databrary established as a working service, we will turn our attention to enhancing the system in ways that will help researchers better find and access Databrary's materials.
Allowing users to annotate video segments is a natural next step.
Full-text search is becoming relatively trivial with off-the-shelf search engines like Apache Solr or Elasticsearch, but the same cannot be said about video data.
Higher level descriptions of video data can assist viewers in finding relevant content, but creating metadata that describes video file content, especially on a frame-by-frame basis, poses challenges.
By extending the video tagging and annotation tools on the session timeline, we will allow researchers themselves to add metadata that will be useful for others to identify interesting segments of video.
Similarly, we will enhance tools for researchers to create their own excerpts -- separate clips from larger video files -- that contain some salient event or example of a phenomenon.
With the permission of the participant, investigators may share excerpts with other scholars and use them in the classroom and at conferences.
Excerpts also become a means within the repository for finding and selecting datasets that have a conceptual relationship.
Since many investigators who collect video do so in conjunction with other temporally dense data streams -- physiological measures (heart rate, brain activity), body motion, or gaze position -- we will explore ways to link Databrary's video assets to external repositories storing these measures, or where feasible, provide internal support for them.
Finally, we plan to incorporate ways to read and write files compatible with the most prevalent video coding/annotation tools used in the developmental and learning science communities.
This will allow researchers who use Mangold or Noldus, for example, to annotate videos to share with colleagues who use another tool.

### Integrate with other services

Databrary we will need to improve its connection with existing library services (i.e. the library catalog and other aggregate searches over existing data repositories).
Going forward, we are well positioned to provide interoperability with library-based metadata schemas (such as export of data packages cross-walked to Dublin Core) and to reach OAI-PMH compliance.
This will automatically incorporate data that researchers add to Databrary into federated library searches with other domain-specific data repositories.

Additionally, By providing a refined API and assigning Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to volumes, we will provide libraries and other information systems the opportunity to tap into Databrary datasets in a more customized fashion.
Minting DOIs for datasets in Databrary will also allow them to be citeable in future journal articles. This helps contributors by making measurable the scholarly impact of deposited data.

### Plan for long-term sustainability

For the time being, Databrary does not charge users for storage or curation services.
The NSF and NICHD project grants bear the cost.
Sustaining domain specific research data repositories on project-specific grants is common, but the model has flaws.
Databrary is part of a consortium of domain specific repositories led by ICPSR that has called for new, more sustainable funding models (Ember et al., 2013).
In the meantime, the project team continues to develop plans for long-term sustainability of Databrary, with focus on the ArXiv (ArXiv, 2015) and ICSPR institutional subscription models, storage volume/curation load based fees-for-service, and professional society partnerships.

## Conclusion

There is an active discussion among library practitioners on the proper role of libraries in the collection and management of research data.
Databrary offers a working model that demonstrates how a research data repository can benefit from interacting closely with the research community.
The project also demonstrates that being strategically and structurally attached to library systems through management, staff, and technology is an important ingredient for success in building a repository.

We do not assume that all data repositories will be able to replicate the exact process Databrary has undertaken.
Larger scale data repositories that serve different fields of research will most likely not have the available staff to shadow every domain their datasets come from.
Though, as discussed in much of the existing literature (Heidorn, 2011; McLure et al. 2014; Simons & Richardson, 2012; MacMillan, 2014), the development of data repositories will require new practices.
It will require the work of information professionals equipped with new skillsets that allow them to translate the needs of the library to research teams. 
It will require leaders capable of navigating between repository, policy, and library workflows, and committed to embedding themselves in the work of researchers who may not have the time or capability of properly preserving their data for the long term.
