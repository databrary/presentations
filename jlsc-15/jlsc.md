## Abstract

## Introduction

- What is Databrary and what purpose does it serve

Databrary (<http://databrary.org>), is a digital data library specialized for storing and sharing videos collected as raw data in the context of research about human and animal behavior. The project has financial support from the National Science Foundation (BCS-1238599) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (U01-HD-076595). New York University (NYU) hosts the library and its staff, with additional support from The Pennsylvania State University (PSU). Databrary began sharing video data in 2014, so the project remains in the early stages of operation. Sharing personally identifiable research materials like video recordings has posed significant challenges along a number of dimensions. In meeting these challenges, Databrary has engaged a wide range of expertise, including substantial support from experts in the NYU Library and project staff with training in library and information science. As such, we think the project offers insights about ways libraries and librarians may engage with scholars in specific topical domains in order to serve emerging demands for sharing research data.

In this paper, we will discuss how Databrary is similar to and differs from existing data repositories. We will describe the project's origins and rationale and motivate the focus on a specific research field (developmental science) and particular data type (recordings, especially video). The storage and sharing of identifiable recordings poses a variety of challenges. We will describe Databrary's solutions to many of them, including the development of policies and procedures to enable the sharing of identifiable data and curation practices and technologies customized for a particular research community. Finally, in laying out a roadmap for enhancements and extensions of Databrary, we will discuss our views about what lessons library and information scientists might draw from the Databrary experience.

### Project Origins and Rationale

- Data sharing a growing focus within research community and with research funding agencies.
- There is no history of sharing within developmental science.
    - Barriers include
        * Collection of sensitive/private data, e.g. video
        * Research ethics policies
        * Technical barriers -- videos are large
        * Curation for sharing not part of scientific workflow
            - No incentive to share, many discincentives
- But, there is a desire to change
        * Databrary's committed contributors
        * Agencies beginning to require data sharing, support data sharing.
        * Evolving policies to enable sharing
        * Video is largely self-documenting, so potential for data re-use is high.
- Sharing with restricted community of researchers
    + Datasets linked to publications
        * Citations
        * Excerpts
        * Other research materials
        * Raw data
    + Cross-referencing among datasets, published papers/studies
    + Expose as much metadata as possible

#### Citations

- Provide valid citations in standard format
- Citations for subcomponents (e.g., excerpts)

### Policies and Data Privacy

- IRB and privacy concerns that needed to be addressed - community building that follows from this

+ Data Sharing Manifesto

### Community Outreach

- Databrary is designed to work more closely with researchers (i.e."designed in the context of researchers").
- Community outreach/training, hands-on support.
- Meeting researchers more than half-way.
- Bringing expertise from library/information science to the research enterprise at an early stage.

### Curation

- Databrary supports both after the fact and active curation

#### After-the-fact/archival

- Curation process (librarians outside of the library, how to gather and standardize metadata, handling many types of data, from in the process of gathering to archival materials gathered decades ago).

#### Active

- Curate data while it is being collected.
    + New in developmental science.
    + Builds on existing common practices.
- Differs from institutional repositories because of focus on a particular research field.
- Serves as the foundation of search and discoverability
- Enough metadata to be useful, but not too much to be unwieldy.
- Spreadsheet interface

### Support from University Entities

- David's point about "Relationship with not only the central library but also with other university central services, such as central IT, sponsored projects, legal."

## The Future of Video Data Sharing

### Expand number and diversity of datasets

- Continue to document and standardize curation processes and learn from library and data services staff about collection development and dataset profiles

### Enhance Databrary's feature-set

- Build on discovery and search (this was in last paper, not sure how relevant it is here)

### Improve Active/Self-Curation

- Field test, adapt based on feedback.

### Integrate with other services

- Connect more with library systems (OAI, Library-specific metadata exports, Linked Data)

### Plan for long-term sustainability
