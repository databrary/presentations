# Databrary: A digital data library for storing and sharing research video

## Andrew Gordon, David S. Millman, Rick O. Gilmore

## Introduction

- What is Databrary and what purpose does it serve
- Where does it sit institutionally
- Roadmap to the rest of the paper

## Literature Review

- Papers that discuss existing data repositories
    + Domain-general vs. domain specific
- Papers that discuss theory or practice of librarianship around data repositories

## Databrary services

### Project Origins and Rationale

- Data sharing a growing focus within research community and with research funding agencies.
- There is no history of sharing within developmental science.
    - Barriers include
        * Collection of sensitive/private data, e.g. video
        * Research ethics policies
        * Technical barriers -- videos are large
        * Curation for sharing not part of scientific workflow
            - No incentive to share, many discincentives
- But, there is a desire to change
        * Databrary's committed contributors
        * Agencies beginning to require data sharing, support data sharing.
        * Evolving policies to enable sharing
        * Video is largely self-documenting, so potential for data re-use is high.
- Sharing with restricted community of researchers
    + Datasets linked to publications
        * Citations
        * Excerpts
        * Other research materials
        * Raw data
    + Cross-referencing among datasets, published papers/studies
    + Expose as much metadata as possible

#### Citations

- Provide valid citations in standard format
- Citations for subcomponents (e.g., excerpts)

### Policies and Data Privacy

- IRB and privacy concerns that needed to be addressed - community building that follows from this

+ Data Sharing Manifesto

### Community Outreach

- Databrary is designed to work more closely with researchers (i.e."designed in the context of researchers").
- Community outreach/training, hands-on support.
- Meeting researchers more than half-way.
- Bringing expertise from library/information science to the research enterprise at an early stage.

### Curation

- Databrary supports both after the fact and active curation

#### After-the-fact/archival

- Curation process (librarians outside of the library, how to gather and standardize metadata, handling many types of data, from in the process of gathering to archival materials gathered decades ago).

#### Active

- Curate data while it is being collected.
    + New in developmental science.
    + Builds on existing common practices.
- Differs from institutional repositories because of focus on a particular research field.

### Support from University Entities

- David's point about "Relationship with not only the central library but also with other university central services, such as central IT, sponsored projects, legal."

## The Future of Video Data Sharing

### Expand number and diversity of datasets

- Continue to document and standardize curation processes and learn from library and data services staff about collection development and dataset profiles

### Enhance Databrary's feature-set
- Build on discovery and search (this was in last paper, not sure how relevant it is here)

### Improve Active/Self-Curation

### Integrate with other services

- Connect more with library systems (OAI, Library-specific metadata exports, Linked Data)

### Plan for long-term sustainability
