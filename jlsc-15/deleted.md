Libraries already house other products of scholarly activity such as journal articles and books, but the raw materials behind published research remains unavailable in most cases.

So, video poses significant challenges to the ideal of open data sharing, but the challenges are balanced by a high potential for accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.

- There is no history of sharing within developmental science.
    - Barriers include
        * Collection of sensitive/private data, e.g. video
        * Research ethics policies
        * Technical barriers -- videos are large
        * Curation for sharing not part of scientific workflow
            - No incentive to share, many discincentives

- Sharing with restricted community of researchers
    + Datasets linked to publications
        * Citations
        * Excerpts
        * Other research materials
        * Raw data
    + Cross-referencing among datasets, published papers/studies
    + Expose as much metadata as possible
    + Restricted access helps with data privacy/security concerns, but may slow adoption (see below).


Concealing participantsâ€™ identity (e.g., by pixilation or blocking faces) would limit the utility of the data. 

As of January 2015, it hosts 5700 video files totaling 1600 hours of recordings along with 2200 additional files. These files comprise 2400 sessions and are covered by 1300 records (including 1100 individual participants). 

In developing the project team and Advisory Board, Databrary's leaders specifically sought out a diverse array of expertise- Databrary is designed to work more closely with researchers (i.e."designed in the context of researchers").
- Community outreach/training, hands-on support.
- Meeting researchers more than half-way.
- Bringing expertise from library/information science to the research enterprise at an early stage (research informationists).
- Approach is working
    - 70+ users in first year, 35 contributors, X files
