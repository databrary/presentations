Dear Gail Clement & Lisa Schiff:

Included in this submission, please find a manuscript entitled: "Researcher-library collaborations: Data repositories as a service for researchers", which we submit for exclusive consideration of publication in the Summer 2015 issue of the Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication.

This paper discusses our experience to date with building and operating the Databrary research data repository, which is a platform for researchers in the developmental and learning sciences to organize, store, and share their research data with other researchers. In it, we explore the ways in which Databrary provides a unique model for how embedded librarians and information professionals might improve the work of researchers while also greatly reducing the barriers to sharing large, video-based datasets within a specific academic domain. We additionally provide details on our institutional collaboration with NYU Libraries and other administrative entities on campus. As such, this paper should be of broad interest to your readership including librarians and library administrators grappling with the challenge of developing and managing shared research data repositories on campus. 

Co-authors of this paper are Rick Gilmore, Associate Director of Databrary, David Milman [preferred qualification], and Lisa Steiger [preferred qualification]. 


Sincerely, 


Andrew Gordon, MSI
Information Engineer
