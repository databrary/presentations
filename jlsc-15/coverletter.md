Dr. ______,

Included in this submission, please find a manuscript entitled: "", which we submit for exclusive consideration of publication in the Summer 2015 issue of Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication.

This paper discusses our experience to date with building and operating the Databrary research data repository, which is a platform for researchers in the developmental and learning sciences to organize, store, and share their research data with other researchers. In it, we explore the ways in which Databrary provides a unique model for how embedded librarians and information professionals might improve the work of reasearchers while also greatly reducing the barriers to sharing large, video-centric data within a specific academic domain. We additionaly provide details on our institutional collaboration with NYU Libraries and other administrative entities on campus. As such, this paper should be of broad interest to your readership including librarians and library administrators grappling with the challenge of developing and managing shared research data repositories on campus. 

The authors on this paper are: Andrew Gordon, Lisa Steiger, David S. Millman, Rick O. Gilmore <!-- need to know what the offical format for this part needs to be - just says "list all co-authors (if applicable)"-->
