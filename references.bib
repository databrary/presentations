Abstract = {In January of 2011, the National Science Foundation began requiring that all proposals for research funding include data management plans. At the time of the mandate, Purdue University's library and campus information technology units had been collaborating on enhancements to the HUBzero virtual research environment. These efforts were parlayed into the development of an institutional, digital data repository and service with the support of the campus research office. In the process, local library science practices have been extended to facilitate research data curation and cyberinfrastructure on campus. Librarians are consulting on data management plans, conducting data reference and instruction, advising on data organization and description, and stewarding collections of data within an evolving library service framework.

Being realized to maintain and give access to the results of complementary phases of the scientific research process, such systems are poorly integrated with one another and generally do not rely on the strengths of the other. Today, such a gap hampers achieving the objectives of the modern scientific communication, that is, publishing, interlinking, and discovery of all outcomes of the research process, from the experimental and observational datasets to the final paper.

One piece of infrastructure that supports these activities is a "distributed institutional repository" that includes electronic documents, digitized archival collections, and research datasets housed in multiple systems that are connected together using Web Services and other middle- ware.

Abstract = {It can be argued that institutional repositories have not had the impact (Lynch 2003; Salo 2008), initially expected, on academic scholarly communications (the exception being in a few well-developed and successful instances). So why should data repositories expect to fare any better? First, data repositories can learn from publication repositories' experiences and their efforts to engage researchers to accept and use these new institutional services. Second, they provide a technical infrastructure for storing and sharing data with the potential for providing access to complimentary research support facilities. Finally, due to the interdisciplinary expertise required to develop and maintain such systems, stronger ties will be forged between libraries, information and computing services, and researchers. This will assist innovation and help to make them sustainable and embedded within academic institutional policy. This paper, while aware of the diverse nature of institutional and depa},

Common hurdles include engaging researchers in the process at the outset, organizing and documenting research data, contending with diverse media types and file formats, spanning disciplines and rewarding participation. Amy Nurnberger of Columbia University Library noted the importance of understanding authors’ needs and recognizing comparable issues faced by libraries and publishers. Jared Lyle of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research stressed the value of working with researchers early in their process and establishing a personal, supportive and consultative connection.

Abstract = {Background The life-science community faces a major challenge in handling "big data", highlighting the need for high quality infrastructures capable of sharing and publishing research data. Data preservation, analysis, and publication are the three pillars in the "big data life cycle". The infrastructures currently available for managing and publishing data are often designed to meet domain-specific or project-specific requirements, resulting in the repeated development of proprietary solutions and lower quality data publication and preservation overall.

Abstract = {Digital research data have introduced a new set of collection, preservation, and service demands into the tradition of digital librarianship. Consequently, the role of an information professional has evolved to include the activities of data curation. This new field more specifically addresses the needs of stewarding and preserving digital research data. In this article, the authors offer an overview of data curation research and education in the field of library and information science, focusing specifically on the current state of professional practice, trends in education and workforce development, and future directions for both basic and applied research. Drawing on the proceedings from two data curation summits held in late 2010, the authors highlight and build on the major insights and recommendations that emerged from discussions among more than 50 leading experts from government agencies, data centers, the field of library and information science, and the publishing industry. },

Libraries’ roles in this increasingly complex area of Web librarianship are often unclearly defined. The authors conducted two focus groups with physicians and researchers at an academic medical center, the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, to gain a better understanding of the current state of data use and data management practices among translational researchers. Data management practices varied widely among departments, disciplines, and research centers, but common areas of concern important to Web librarianship included privacy, data access, and data stewardship. The results provided qualitative information about creating, managing, maintaining, and validating data in clinical and research environments, and challenges working with clinical research data in universities.

Abstract = {Scientists produce vast amounts of data that often are not preserved properly or do not have inventories, placing them at risk. As part of an effort to more fully understand the data-at-risk predicament, researchers who were engaged in the DARI project at UNC's Metadata Research Center surveyed information custodians working in a range of settings. The survey collected information on the data characteristics and preservation plans. Forty-three information custodians completed the survey. The results indicate that at-risk data include a variety of formats subject areas, and ownership status, as well as compliance with a variety of standards. Although a majority of respondents agree that data preservation is important, they caution that time is the greatest barrier to sharing these data. The study has implications for data rescue and for training information custodians. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

   abstract = {Researchers are producing an unprecedented deluge of data by using new methods and instrumentation. Others may wish to mine these data for new discoveries and innovations. However, research data are not readily available as sharing is common in only a few fields such as astronomy and genomics. Data sharing practices in other fields vary widely. Moreover, research data take many forms, are handled in many ways, using many approaches, and often are difficult to interpret once removed from their initial context. Data sharing is thus a conundrum. Four rationales for sharing data are examined, drawing examples from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities: (1) to reproduce or to verify research, (2) to make results of publicly funded research available to the public, (3) to enable others to ask new questions of extant data, and (4) to advance the state of research and innovation. These rationales differ by the arguments for sharing, by beneficiaries, and by the motivations and incentives of the many stakeholders involved. The challenges are to understand which data might be shared, by whom, with whom, under what conditions, why, and to what effects. Answers will inform data policy and practice. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

   abstract = {Purpose - As libraries become more involved in curating research data, reference librarians will need to be trained in conducting data interviews with researchers to better understand their data and associated needs. This article seeks to identify and provide definitions for the basic terms and concepts of data curation for librarians to properly frame and carry out a data interview using the Data Curation Profiles (DCP) Toolkit. Design/methodology/approach - The DCP Toolkit is a semi-structured interview designed to assist librarians in identifying the data curation needs of researchers. The components of the DCP Toolkit were analyzed to determine the base level of knowledge needed for librarians to conduct effective data interviews. Specific concepts, definitions, and examples were sought through a review of articles, case studies, practitioner resources and from the experiences of the Purdue University Libraries. Findings - Data curation concepts and terminology are not yet well-defined and often vary across, or even within fields of study. This research informed the development of a workshop to train librarians in using the DCP Toolkit. The definitions and concepts addressed in the workshop include: data, data set, data lifecycle, data curation, data sharing, and roles for reference librarians. Practical implications - Conducting a data interview can be a daunting task given the complexity of data curation and the lack of shared definitions. Practical tools and training are needed to help librarians develop capacity in data curation. Originality/value - This article provides practical information for public service librarians to help them conceptualize and conduct a data interview with researchers. (English)},

Darling Biomedical Library is an academic health sciences library serving the clinical, educational, and research needs of the UCLA community. Methods: A grant from the National Library of Medicine funded a librarian to join a UCLA research team as an informationist. The informationist meets regularly with the research team and provides guidance related to data management, preservation, and other information-related issues. Main Results: Early results suggest that the informationist's involvement has influenced the team's data gathering, storage, and curation methods. The UCLA Library has also changed the librarian's title to research informationist to reflect the new activities that she performs. Conclusion: The research informationist role provides an opportunity for librarians to become effective members of research teams and improve research output. (English)},

   abstract = {A prototype Digital Video Library was developed as part of a project to assist rural primary care clinics with diagnosis of autism, funded by the National Network of Libraries of Medicine. The Digital Video Library takes play sample videos generated by a rural clinic and makes it available to experts at the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) Clinic at The University of Alabama. The experts are able to annotate segments of the video using an integrated version of the Childhood Autism Ratings Scale-Second Edition Standard Version (CARS2). The Digital Video Library then extracts the annotated segments, and provides a robust search and browse feature. The videos can then be accessed by the subject's primary care physician. This article summarizes the development and features of the Digital Video Library. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

   abstract = {It can be argued that institutional repositories have not had the impact (Lynch 2003; Salo 2008), initially expected, on academic scholarly communications (the exception being in a few well-developed and successful instances). So why should data repositories expect to fare any better? First, data repositories can learn from publication repositories' experiences and their efforts to engage researchers to accept and use these new institutional services. Second, they provide a technical infrastructure for storing and sharing data with the potential for providing access to complimentary research support facilities. Finally, due to the interdisciplinary expertise required to develop and maintain such systems, stronger ties will be forged between libraries, information and computing services, and researchers. This will assist innovation and help to make them sustainable and embedded within academic institutional policy. This paper, while aware of the diverse nature of institutional and departmental practices, aims to highlight a number of initiatives in the Universities of Edinburgh and Oxford, showing how research data repository infrastructures can be effectively realized through collaboration and sharing of expertise. We argue that by employing agile community, strategic and policy judgment, a robust data repository infrastructure will be part of an integrated solution to effectively manage institutional research data assets.

   abstract = {Significant advances have been made over the past ten years to standardize the data emerging from the proteomic workflows adopted by laboratories all over the world. Differences in workflows, instrumentation, analysis software and reporting methods initially resulted in very disparate data being generated by many of these research groups, making data storage and comparison challenging. As the data standards proposed by the HUPO-PSI have increasingly been adopted, and tools and databases implementing these data formats have become more readily available, data generated by these complex experimental procedures is now becoming easier to manipulate, to visualize and to analyse. Public domain databases now exist to collate the information generated by experimentalists and to make the generation of specific protein expression maps, and monitoring of changes in protein expression levels in response to external stimuli a real possibility. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Computational Proteomics in the Post-Identification Era. Guest Editors: Martin Eisenacher and Christian Stephan.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION Institutional repositories play a critical role in the research lifecycle. Funding agencies are increasingly seeking an improved return on their investment in research. Repositories facilitate this process by providing storage of, and access to, institutional research outputs and, more recently, research data. While repositories are generally managed within the academic library, repository staff require different skills and knowledge compared with traditional library roles. This study reports on a survey of Australasian institutional repository staff to identify skills and knowledge sets. METHODS Institutional repository staff working at universities in Australia and New Zealand were invited to participate in an online survey which incorporated both open and closed-ended question types. RESULTS The survey found significant gaps in the current provision of formal training and coursework related to institutional repositories, which echoed findings in the United Kingdom, Italy, and the United States. DISCUSSION There is clearly a need for more and varied training opportunities for repository professionals. Repository work requires a specific set of skills that can be difficult to find and institutions will benefit from investing in training and ongoing development opportunities for repository staff. CONCLUSION The data from this study could be used to facilitate staff recruitment, development, training, and retention strategies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
