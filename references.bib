   abstract = {This paper presents a brief literature review and then introduces the methods, design, and construction of the Data Curation Profile, an instrument that can be used to provide detailed information on particular data forms that might be curated by an academic library. These data forms are presented in the context of the related sub-disciplinary research area, and they provide the flow of the research process from which these data are generated. The profiles also represent the needs for data curation from the perspective of the data producers, using their own language. As such, they support the exploration of data curation across different research domains in real and practical terms. With the sponsorship of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, investigators from Purdue University and the University of Illinois interviewed 19 faculty subjects to identify needs for discovery, access, preservation, and reuse of their research data. For each subject, a profile was constructed that includes information about his or her general research, data forms and stages, value of data, data ingest, intellectual property, organization and description of data, tools, interoperability, impact and prestige, data management, and preservation. Each profile also presents a specific dataset supplied by the subject to serve as a concrete example. The Data Curation Profiles are being published to a public wiki for questions and discussion, and a blank template will be disseminated with guidelines for others to create and share their own profiles. This study was conducted primarily from the viewpoint of librarians interacting with faculty researchers; however, it is expected that these findings will complement a wide variety of data curation research and practice outside of librarianship and the university environment.},

   abstract = {Objectives From 2003 to 2013, RTI International served as the data repository for the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). RTI worked closely with two sample repository partners to build and maintain the Central Repository (CR) that made data and samples available to approved requestors. In this paper, we recap aspects of establishing the mechanism; detail the challenges and limitations of data and sample sharing, and explore the future of resource sharing in light of the evolving environment of research funding.
Design and methods Effective maintenance required the system to be flexible and dynamic while at the same time compliant with established data standards.
Results Our years serving as the CR for NIDDK have yielded a number of observations about the difficulties of running a repository, an operation that is by definition dependent on many outside parties whose degree of expertise and efficiency have a direct impact on repository functioning.
Conclusion The bio-banking industry will likely continue to become more globally centralized for studying specific genetic diseases and monitoring the health of our environment. The dynamic relationship between emerging technologies and the infrastructure will be needed to support future research that requires the ability of organizations providing support to remain flexible even while following established standards.
•We were funded to develop the NIDDK central Repository.•We describe the design and implementation of this Repository.•We discovered that the design had to be flexible and compliant with data standards.•The operation of a large repository depends on many outside parties.•These different points of view have to be reconciled.•We conjecture that the bio-banking industry will become focused on specific diseases.•Emerging technologies will affect existing repository infrastructures.},

   abstract = {Background: The life-science community faces a major challenge in handling "big data", highlighting the need for high quality infrastructures capable of sharing and publishing research data. Data preservation, analysis, and publication are the three pillars in the "big data life cycle". The infrastructures currently available for managing and publishing data are often designed to meet domain-specific or project-specific requirements, resulting in the repeated development of proprietary solutions and lower quality data publication and preservation overall.; Results: e!DAL is a lightweight software framework for publishing and sharing research data. Its main features are version tracking, metadata management, information retrieval, registration of persistent identifiers (DOI), an embedded HTTP(S) server for public data access, access as a network file system, and a scalable storage backend. e!DAL is available as an API for local non-shared storage and as a remote API featuring distributed applications. It can be deployed "out-of-the-box" as an on-site repository.; Conclusions: e!DAL was developed based on experiences coming from decades of research data management at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK). Initially developed as a data publication and documentation infrastructure for the IPK's role as a data center in the DataCite consortium, e!DAL has grown towards being a general data archiving and publication infrastructure. The e!DAL software has been deployed into the Maven Central Repository. Documentation and Software are also available at: http://edal.ipk-gatersleben.de.;},

   abstract = {Behavioral observation is one of several measurement approaches available to investigators engaged in quantitative behavioral research. It is often the method of choice when nonverbal organisms are studied (or nonverbal behavior generally); when more natural, spontaneous, real-world behavior is of interest; and when processes and not outcomes are the focus (e.g., questions of contingency). Compared with other approaches, it is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. Coding schemes—the basic measuring instrument of behavioral observation—need to be developed and observers trained in their reliable use, and the often-voluminous data initially collected need to be reduced to simple rates and probabilities or contingency indexes for later analyses. Behavior can be observed live or recorded for later viewing (and re-viewing). Observers either assign codes to predetermined time intervals (interval recording) or detect and code events in the stream of behavior (event recording), using instruments that vary from simple pencil and paper to sophisticated computer systems. Coded data can be represented in a code-unit grid as interval, untimed event or multievent, or timed-event data; the latter offers the most options but works best with electronic equipment. Behavioral observation can be used for experimental or nonexperimental studies, in laboratory or field settings, and with single-subject or group designs using between- or within-subjects variables. Summary scores derived from observational sessions can be subjected to any appropriate statistical approach from null-hypothesis testing to mathematical modeling (Rodgers, 2010).

   abstract = {Researchers are producing an unprecedented deluge of data by using new methods and instrumentation. Others may wish to mine these data for new discoveries and innovations. However, research data are not readily available as sharing is common in only a few fields such as astronomy and genomics. Data sharing practices in other fields vary widely. Moreover, research data take many forms, are handled in many ways, using many approaches, and often are difficult to interpret once removed from their initial context. Data sharing is thus a conundrum. Four rationales for sharing data are examined, drawing examples from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities: (1) to reproduce or to verify research, (2) to make results of publicly funded research available to the public, (3) to enable others to ask new questions of extant data, and (4) to advance the state of research and innovation. These rationales differ by the arguments for sharing, by beneficiaries, and by the motivations and incentives of the many stakeholders involved. The challenges are to understand which data might be shared, by whom, with whom, under what conditions, why, and to what effects. Answers will inform data policy and practice. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

   abstract = {Purpose - As libraries become more involved in curating research data, reference librarians will need to be trained in conducting data interviews with researchers to better understand their data and associated needs. This article seeks to identify and provide definitions for the basic terms and concepts of data curation for librarians to properly frame and carry out a data interview using the Data Curation Profiles (DCP) Toolkit. Design/methodology/approach - The DCP Toolkit is a semi-structured interview designed to assist librarians in identifying the data curation needs of researchers. The components of the DCP Toolkit were analyzed to determine the base level of knowledge needed for librarians to conduct effective data interviews. Specific concepts, definitions, and examples were sought through a review of articles, case studies, practitioner resources and from the experiences of the Purdue University Libraries. Findings - Data curation concepts and terminology are not yet well-defined and often vary across, or even within fields of study. This research informed the development of a workshop to train librarians in using the DCP Toolkit. The definitions and concepts addressed in the workshop include: data, data set, data lifecycle, data curation, data sharing, and roles for reference librarians. Practical implications - Conducting a data interview can be a daunting task given the complexity of data curation and the lack of shared definitions. Practical tools and training are needed to help librarians develop capacity in data curation. Originality/value - This article provides practical information for public service librarians to help them conceptualize and conduct a data interview with researchers. (English)},

   abstract = {The two pillars of the modern scientific communication are Data Centers and Research Digital Libraries (RDLs), whose technologies and admin staff support researchers at storing, curating, sharing, and discovering the data and the publications they produce. Being realized to maintain and give access to the results of complementary phases of the scientific research process, such systems are poorly integrated with one another and generally do not rely on the strengths of the other. Today, such a gap hampers achieving the objectives of the modern scientific communication, that is, publishing, interlinking, and discovery of all outcomes of the research process, from the experimental and observational datasets to the final paper. In this work, we envision that instrumental to bridge the gap is the construction of “Scientific Communication Infrastructures”. The main goal of these infrastructures is to facilitate interoperability between Data Centers and RDLs and to provide services that simplify the implementation of the large variety of modern scientific communication patterns.

Given academic libraries' curation and preservation expertise, libraries are well suited to support the data quality process. Data quality measurements are discussed, including the fundamental elements of trust, authenticity, understandability, usability and integrity, and are applied to the Digital Curation Lifecycle model to demonstrate how these measures can be used to understand and evaluate data quality within the curatorial process. Opportunities for improvement and challenges are identified as areas that are fruitful for future research and exploration. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The Digital Video Library takes play sample videos generated by a rural clinic and makes it available to experts at the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) Clinic at The University of Alabama. The experts are able to annotate segments of the video using an integrated version of the Childhood Autism Ratings Scale-Second Edition Standard Version (CARS2). The Digital Video Library then extracts the annotated segments, and provides a robust search and browse feature. The videos can then be accessed by the subject's primary care physician.

   abstract = {•Propose data sharing model based on motivational, institutional, and resource factors.•The research model was validated by the results of a survey of 361 social scientists.•Career benefit and risk significantly affect social scientists’ data sharing attitude.•Attitude, effort, and norm significantly influence social scientists’ data sharing.•Funding agency and journal's pressures and data repository need to be more encouraged.
The purpose of this study is to locate individual, institutional, and resource factors that influence data sharing behaviors among social scientists. Given the benefits to the social science disciplines in the advancement of scholarship, and the recent data sharing policy changes of funding agencies, it is necessary to determine the factors that support and impede data sharing behaviors. A research model was developed and validated based on the results of a survey of 361 social scientists. The model is informed by theory of planned behavior and institutional theory to map underlying individual motivations, institutional pressures, and availability of resources facilitating social scientists’ data sharing. It was found that social scientists’ data sharing behaviors are mainly driven by personal motivations (i.e., perceived career benefit and risk, perceived effort, and attitude toward data sharing) and perceived normative pressure. Funding agencies’ pressure, journals’ pressure, and availability of data repository were not found to be significant factors in influencing social scientists’ data sharing. This research suggests that personal motivations and norm of data sharing currently support social scientists’ data sharing; however, institutional pressures by funding agencies and journals and data repository need to be further encouraged to better facilitate social scientists’ data sharing behaviors.},

   abstract = {Technology usage is changing rapidly and is becoming a more mobile, more social and more multimedia-based experience. This is especially true in the area of content creation where mobile social applications used by crowds of people are challenging traditional ways of creating and distributing content, especially for applications like news dissemination. Libraries have traditionally functioned as repositories where the information content of a society is analysed, curated, organised and stored, acting as a permanent record of what is to be remembered from a society. How can this function be achieved by present-day libraries attempting to cope with mobile, social, multimedia content who's nature and utility of which change the type of information we wish to curate and store? This information is both dynamic and organic, posing challenges to the more fixed models of information in digital libraries. In this article we describe two digital library systems that archive video content from the sports domain, and which support user annotations and merging of diverse information sources in an integrated way. We report on analysis of the deployment of these two systems and highlight how they extend the traditional role of a (digital) library. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

   abstract = {The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) was founded over 50 years ago "to further the development of research in political science" (Miller 1963:11). Since that summer of 1962, the scope and range of services ICPSR offers has expanded significantly to encompass the wider social and behavioral research community, and from a handful of data collections to thousands. With over 750 consortial members from around the world, ICPSR is now a leader in preserving, curating, and providing access to scientific data so others can reuse the data and validate research findings. Much of the success of ICPSR can be traced back to the consortial model upon which the organization was founded, with members providing funding, input, and a sense of community.

   abstract = {It can be argued that institutional repositories have not had the impact (Lynch 2003; Salo 2008), initially expected, on academic scholarly communications (the exception being in a few well-developed and successful instances). So why should data repositories expect to fare any better? First, data repositories can learn from publication repositories' experiences and their efforts to engage researchers to accept and use these new institutional services. Second, they provide a technical infrastructure for storing and sharing data with the potential for providing access to complimentary research support facilities. Finally, due to the interdisciplinary expertise required to develop and maintain such systems, stronger ties will be forged between libraries, information and computing services, and researchers. This will assist innovation and help to make them sustainable and embedded within academic institutional policy. This paper, while aware of the diverse nature of institutional and departmental practices, aims to highlight a number of initiatives in the Universities of Edinburgh and Oxford, showing how research data repository infrastructures can be effectively realized through collaboration and sharing of expertise. We argue that by employing agile community, strategic and policy judgment, a robust data repository infrastructure will be part of an integrated solution to effectively manage institutional research data assets.

   abstract = {Drawing from the literatures of science, scholarly communication, and librarianship, this review paper describes what librarians need to know about how scientists manage and share their data. It is intended to help librarians become more engaged and integral partners in research and education. Scientific data repositories, journal data deposition policies, and the development of persistent linking between scholarly publications and data sets, have made data more accessible. However, deposition and sharing practices still vary among researchers, journal publishers, data repositories, information providers, and universities. Understanding the dynamic relationships between these stakeholders is critical to providing relevant support to researchers and students in the sciences. Librarians need to develop skills that bridge traditional liaison work with the increasingly data-driven demands of scientific research, so that we can support researchers with their data management needs and help users discover data across myriad collections and resources.

   abstract = {An academic scientist's professional success depends on publishing. Publishing norms emphasize novel, positive results. As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive-getting it right-competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive-getting it published. This article develops strategies for improving scientific practices and knowledge accumulation that account for ordinary human motivations and biases.},

   abstract = {Significant advances have been made over the past ten years to standardize the data emerging from the proteomic workflows adopted by laboratories all over the world. Differences in workflows, instrumentation, analysis software and reporting methods initially resulted in very disparate data being generated by many of these research groups, making data storage and comparison challenging. As the data standards proposed by the HUPO-PSI have increasingly been adopted, and tools and databases implementing these data formats have become more readily available, data generated by these complex experimental procedures is now becoming easier to manipulate, to visualize and to analyse. Public domain databases now exist to collate the information generated by experimentalists and to make the generation of specific protein expression maps, and monitoring of changes in protein expression levels in response to external stimuli a real possibility. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Computational Proteomics in the Post-Identification Era. Guest Editors: Martin Eisenacher and Christian Stephan.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION Institutional repositories play a critical role in the research lifecycle. Funding agencies are increasingly seeking an improved return on their investment in research. Repositories facilitate this process by providing storage of, and access to, institutional research outputs and, more recently, research data. While repositories are generally managed within the academic library, repository staff require different skills and knowledge compared with traditional library roles. This study reports on a survey of Australasian institutional repository staff to identify skills and knowledge sets. METHODS Institutional repository staff working at universities in Australia and New Zealand were invited to participate in an online survey which incorporated both open and closed-ended question types. RESULTS The survey found significant gaps in the current provision of formal training and coursework related to institutional repositories, which echoed findings in the United Kingdom, Italy, and the United States. DISCUSSION There is clearly a need for more and varied training opportunities for repository professionals. Repository work requires a specific set of skills that can be difficult to find and institutions will benefit from investing in training and ongoing development opportunities for repository staff. CONCLUSION The data from this study could be used to facilitate staff recruitment, development, training, and retention strategies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

   abstract = {At ASIS&T’s RDAP13 Summit, one panel explored the shared interests and challenges faced by researchers, institutions, various repositories, publishers and the public. Common hurdles include engaging researchers in the process at the outset, organizing and documenting research data, contending with diverse media types and file formats, spanning disciplines and rewarding participation. Amy Nurnberger of Columbia University Library noted the importance of understanding authors’ needs and recognizing comparable issues faced by libraries and publishers. Jared Lyle of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research stressed the value of working with researchers early in their process and establishing a personal, supportive and consultative connection. John Kunze described tools available through the California Digital Library to facilitate data curation at several stages of the research process, ultimately depositing data to a repository and enabling its publication and sharing. The collective experiences highlighted common themes, including the value of local collections and partnerships as well as the need to simplify the process with easy-to-use tools.

   abstract = {In January of 2011, the National Science Foundation began requiring that all proposals for research funding include data management plans. At the time of the mandate, Purdue University's library and campus information technology units had been collaborating on enhancements to the HUBzero virtual research environment. These efforts were parlayed into the development of an institutional, digital data repository and service with the support of the campus research office. In the process, local library science practices have been extended to facilitate research data curation and cyberinfrastructure on campus. Librarians are consulting on data management plans, conducting data reference and instruction, advising on data organization and description, and stewarding collections of data within an evolving library service framework.
