Abstract = {In January of 2011, the National Science Foundation began requiring that all proposals for research funding include data management plans. At the time of the mandate, Purdue University's library and campus information technology units had been collaborating on enhancements to the HUBzero virtual research environment. These efforts were parlayed into the development of an institutional, digital data repository and service with the support of the campus research office. In the process, local library science practices have been extended to facilitate research data curation and cyberinfrastructure on campus. Librarians are consulting on data management plans, conducting data reference and instruction, advising on data organization and description, and stewarding collections of data within an evolving library service framework.

Being realized to maintain and give access to the results of complementary phases of the scientific research process, such systems are poorly integrated with one another and generally do not rely on the strengths of the other. Today, such a gap hampers achieving the objectives of the modern scientific communication, that is, publishing, interlinking, and discovery of all outcomes of the research process, from the experimental and observational datasets to the final paper.

One piece of infrastructure that supports these activities is a "distributed institutional repository" that includes electronic documents, digitized archival collections, and research datasets housed in multiple systems that are connected together using Web Services and other middle- ware.

Abstract = {Objectives From 2003 to 2013, RTI International served as the data repository for the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). RTI worked closely with two sample repository partners to build and maintain the Central Repository (CR) that made data and samples available to approved requestors. In this paper, we recap aspects of establishing the mechanism; detail the challenges and limitations of data and sample sharing, and explore the future of resource sharing in light of the evolving environment of research funding.},

Abstract = {Given the significance of the role of data in research and the value of data for long-term use, researchers have been discussing the need for archiving and curating research data for future studies. To make data reusable, managing data in a reliable way and making them understandable to users is significant. This paper examines the current requirements for depositing data in selected data repositories by analyzing the forms and guidelines for such deposits. The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) is used as a framework for examining current requirements. Examining current data deposit requirements provides an opportunity to validate current data collection and management practices and provides insights into ways to improve such practices.

Abstract = {It can be argued that institutional repositories have not had the impact (Lynch 2003; Salo 2008), initially expected, on academic scholarly communications (the exception being in a few well-developed and successful instances). So why should data repositories expect to fare any better? First, data repositories can learn from publication repositories' experiences and their efforts to engage researchers to accept and use these new institutional services. Second, they provide a technical infrastructure for storing and sharing data with the potential for providing access to complimentary research support facilities. Finally, due to the interdisciplinary expertise required to develop and maintain such systems, stronger ties will be forged between libraries, information and computing services, and researchers. This will assist innovation and help to make them sustainable and embedded within academic institutional policy. This paper, while aware of the diverse nature of institutional and depa},

Abstract = {At ASIS&T’s RDAP13 Summit, one panel explored the shared interests and challenges faced by researchers, institutions, various repositories, publishers and the public. Common hurdles include engaging researchers in the process at the outset, organizing and documenting research data, contending with diverse media types and file formats, spanning disciplines and rewarding participation. Amy Nurnberger of Columbia University Library noted the importance of understanding authors’ needs and recognizing comparable issues faced by libraries and publishers. Jared Lyle of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research stressed the value of working with researchers early in their process and establishing a personal, supportive and consultative connection. John Kunze described tools available through the California Digital Library to facilitate data curation at several stages of the research process, ultimately depositing data to a repository and enabling its publication and sh},

Abstract = {Background The life-science community faces a major challenge in handling "big data", highlighting the need for high quality infrastructures capable of sharing and publishing research data. Data preservation, analysis, and publication are the three pillars in the "big data life cycle". The infrastructures currently available for managing and publishing data are often designed to meet domain-specific or project-specific requirements, resulting in the repeated development of proprietary solutions and lower quality data publication and preservation overall. Results e!DAL is a lightweight software framework for publishing and sharing research data. Its main features are version tracking, metadata management, information retrieval, registration of persistent identifiers (DOI), an embedded HTTP(S) server for public data access, access as a network file system, and a scalable storage backend. e!DAL is available as an API for local non-shared storage and as a remote API featuring distributed },

Abstract = {Digital research data have introduced a new set of collection, preservation, and service demands into the tradition of digital librarianship. Consequently, the role of an information professional has evolved to include the activities of data curation. This new field more specifically addresses the needs of stewarding and preserving digital research data. In this article, the authors offer an overview of data curation research and education in the field of library and information science, focusing specifically on the current state of professional practice, trends in education and workforce development, and future directions for both basic and applied research. Drawing on the proceedings from two data curation summits held in late 2010, the authors highlight and build on the major insights and recommendations that emerged from discussions among more than 50 leading experts from government agencies, data centers, the field of library and information science, and the publishing industry. },

Abstract = {How translational researchers use data is becoming an important support function for librariesto understand. Libraries’ roles in this increasingly complex area of Web librarianship are often unclearly defined. The authors conducted two focus groups with physicians and researchers at an academic medical center, the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, to gain a better understanding of the current state of data use and data management practices among translational researchers. Data management practices varied widely among departments, disciplines, and research centers, but common areas of concern important to Web librarianship included privacy, data access, and data stewardship. The results provided qualitative information about creating, managing, maintaining, and validating data in clinical and research environments, and challenges working with clinical research data in universities. These results inform current practices around data access, data sharing, and privacy of research part},

Abstract = {Scientists produce vast amounts of data that often are not preserved properly or do not have inventories, placing them at risk. As part of an effort to more fully understand the data-at-risk predicament, researchers who were engaged in the DARI project at UNC's Metadata Research Center surveyed information custodians working in a range of settings. The survey collected information on the data characteristics and preservation plans. Forty-three information custodians completed the survey. The results indicate that at-risk data include a variety of formats subject areas, and ownership status, as well as compliance with a variety of standards. Although a majority of respondents agree that data preservation is important, they caution that time is the greatest barrier to sharing these data. The study has implications for data rescue and for training information custodians. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
