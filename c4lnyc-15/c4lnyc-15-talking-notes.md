C4L presentation notes

0.
  - Databrary is a repository for research video collected by child development researchers
  - Databrary is an open source software project, but this isn't necessarily about technology
  - I'd like to talk about our experience with addressing the challenge of collecting and sharing research data  

1/2.
  - This is the idea behind sharing research data
  - Digital data everywhere in academia
  - Funders and Institutions pushing for more sharing of the materials that go into publications
  - More researchers can share in expensive and valuable datasets when they don't have the resources to collect their own

3/4. 
  - But the reality is not quite syncing with expectation.
  - Researchers may be expected to perform intensive organization and description of data even after all the hard work of collecting it is done
  - Ethical challenges prohibit free and easy sharing of human subject or animal subject data
  - Finally, it's not really clear what might be good to share: analyses? figures? raw data?

5.
  - This talk will focus more on a very specific set of researchers and the raw materials of their research
  - Reasearch in the behavioral sciences make abundant use of video because it allows you to record subjects and study their actions in very granular ways
  - Examples...

6.
  - And video has great potential for reuse
  - What one researcher records can be used in vastly different ways for another researcher
  - It's information rich, but expensive and time-consuming to collect.

7.
  - Databrary is a web-accessible video data repository for the purposes of sharing and reusing materials collected by these types of researchers

8.
  - The rest of this talk discusses what Databrary provides to get researchers on board and the challenges involved there. These are not domain specific problems.

9.
  - The traditional model for curation...
  - But this is not without it's drawbacks


10.
  - Any given dataset can include paper records containing important metadata that are organized in any given fashion

11.
  - Digital files and metadata are also organized in any given fashion, it takes a lot of communication to figure out how a dataset fits into Databrary for standardization

12.
  - Finally a lot of the video has been capture on analog media, and we have to determine if it can be digitized and how (the scope of our project is limited in this respect to a few exemplary or high priority datasets)

13.
  - More to the software development side, we offer tools and interfaces in the browser, as part of databrary, that guide researchers to curate their own data as they collect it.


14.
  - Demonstration models how a researcher can work through the workflow of curating their own data on Databrary.


15. 
  - Speaking more generally, what have we learned that can apply to other projects that expect to collect and provide acces to research data for sharing?
