Code4LibNYC Databrary Presentation Outline
=========================================

0. Sharing of Research Data (Motivation - Stating what we may already know)

	- More and more digital data
	- More and more compulsion to share and doing things out in the open
	- Share the wealth, a boon to the community
	- Changing how research communities validate and reuse knowledge and materials

0. A Specific type of Data and Data collecting community

	- Child development research
	- Costly to capture and store
	- Replicability is important, but video has a greater potential for reuse...
	- But few existing incentives or tools enabling researchers to share and make use of other's work

0. Databrary

	- Grant funded by NIH/NSF
	- Housed in NYU Steinhardt, collaborating with Libraries and ITS for storage and preservation support -> a unique setup
	- Web-accessible digital library and disciplinary repository for authorized researchers in this domain anywhere (not just NYU)
	- Open Source (github)

0. What does the actual implementation look like?

	- Snapshot of interface
	- Thinking a lot about usability
	- Input from a lot of different stakeholders, with different aims in mind.
	- A lot of outreach ... workshops
	- Next steps: analysis in the browser, how repositories can also be work spaces?

0. The challenges of curating such research data raw materials
	
	- This type of research has very little standardization
	- Also, human subject data has a lot of privacy concerns that need to be observed.
	- These assets are in any type of format, physical shape/level of corruption
	- We get datasets in various stages of organization, or not yet organized
	- Researchers do not have the time to do all the preparations for sharing. 
	- What to keep and why, at what point in RDM do you step in and start collecting, where do you draw the line?

0. Implications for other types of research data management in libraries (what we learned)
	
	- Regardless of the data format - watch how researchers work (particularly where there's little prescribed standard (social sciences, mainly))
	- From this, define the community (a user) and their workflows to inform usability.
	- Remove discincentives, provide incentives (for new responsibilities in research) - failing to do so risks low adoption rates from target audience, or poorly described data.
	- Defining scope, precluding the ethical concerns
	- Technical solutions are just part of the picture, still a great level of service (can't automate everything)

0. Also want to hear what others are working on...
