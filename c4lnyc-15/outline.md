=========================================

0. Why Specifically Research Video

	- Costly to capture and store
	- A lot of redundancy 
	- Can capture a lot with video
	- Researchers that can't access certain pops. can use others - if only they were available

0. Sharing Reuse of Research Video

	- Imperative
	- Federally mandated
	- A boon to the community
	- Improve the field overall

0. The challenges of curating such research data raw materials
	
	- This type of research has very little standardization
	- These assets are in any type of format, physical shape/level of corruption
	- We get datasets in various stages of organization, or not yet organized
	- Researchers do not have the time to do all the preparations for sharing. 

0. Creating a system

	- A lot of help from the library
	- Thinking a lot about usability
	- Sometimes that's not always the library-goal
	- 

0. Implications for other types of research data management in libraries (what we learned)
	
	- Watch researchers and how they work (particularly where there's little prescribed standard (social sciences, mainly))
	- Remove discincentives, provide incentives (for new responsibilities in research)
	- Defining scope, precluding the ethical concerns
	- Still a great level of service (can't automate everything)
	-
