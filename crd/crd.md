###ABSTRACT (is this necessary?)

Curation of video data used in research of human behavior has a very specific set of use cases and challenges.
Video of human behavior is more readily understandable on a raw viewing than are opaque datasets of encoded variables and values. 
Though the context of video within this type of research is defined by other research materials. 
Video files and their accompanying materials and metadata comprise the datasets to be collected, described, and shared for reuse.
Curating these videos and related materials present a specific set of challenges, though many of these challenges are shared across domains and across different formats and relationships of research process materials. 
Primary challenges include the difficulty of describing a dataset at length for a different purpose than it was originally collected, transporting these files for deposit, and representing them in ways that others would be able to understand and make use of.
These challenges are compounded by the traditional model of post-hoc data curation, context and information is lost from the original collection and effort is duplicate. 
Databrary is a web-based video library for the developmental and learning sciences.
In developing a user-friendly web interface for researchers to upload, share, and reuse video data, we realized early on that we needed a way for researchers to curate and manage their own data as they collected it.
The results are...
