notes on a case study for Curating Research Data: Practical Strategies for Your Digital Repository
==================================================================================================

0. Upload as you go.
1. Building collections with research data is hard
2. Researchers are hard-pressed to gather up and annotate their data for deposit when they are done with it.
3. At the same time, they are already being pushed to take an active approach on data management plans
4. In providing a data management and sharing/reuse platform for video data, we learned early on that collecing this data after the fact was problematic for two reasons
    a. it was difficult to gather it all up
    b. more importantly, it had been collected under an entirely different set of releases
5. Upload as you go is the solution for merging data management with data curation for sharing and discoverability

- would this in anyway be related to the human research subject dimension?
- that is, is the workflow defined by the policy and informed consent requirement?
- how to curate and share human subject data?
- what's the pipeline (starting with getting consent)

*** As a case study, what is the best way to convey this to those working specifically in the Library, where building another Databrary is not exactly an option.

  - This is how we are set up and this is how we have conceptualized and addressed the challenge of curation (building an interface)
  - While not replicable on the whole, there has to be are that it can be adapted for those in the library.
  - Don't focus on the technology, focus on the interactions, the intention, and the connection of skillsets.
  
##Outline

###INTRODUCTION
Brief assessment of the challenge that Databrary is trying to meet.
- Video presents unique opportunities for sharing
- But video data are difficult to share:
    - Current research practices around collecting and managing video data differ from lab to lab
    - Video data are large and therefore difficult to transport
    - That also makes them expensive to store in aggregate
- In this specifc domain (and many others like it), collecting video data present challenges for participant privacy since it's possible to identify a participant by face or voice where any other PII are redacted.
- Labs all have different data management practices - small science (or should we avoid that conversation at this point)
- Furthermore, this type of active curation is very specific to how datasets in the behavioural sciences come together, but as datasets are characterized by many component pieces, we think this approach would potentially apply to any domain where data are collected in many pieces and over time.

Databrary is the solution to these challenges. But, even if we create Datarbary with overcoming these essential challenges, we still need to get video data and metadata into the repository. Beyond resolving the underlying challenges to _sharing_ data, these are the practical challenges to gathering and curating data:
- Getting the right before collection, it's difficult to go back and revise the consents
- Significant cleaning and shaping of data is necessary for ingest. If collecting in Databrary, no cleaning
- Researchers are loathe to return to a dataset to get it described and annotated for sharing with others on a general level
- Motivations for sharing research data are diffuse (Youngseek & Adler, 2015)

- There are long term concerns (preservation, findability, understandability) and there are immediate access concerns (policies, reuse, understandability). There's the Institutional Repository and the Archive. (RDM:Practical Strategies for Information Professionals - p. 204)


###STEPS TOWARDS ACTIVE CURATION
- Conduct interviews of sample labs: how do they collect their data, how do they expect to access their data, how do they expect to access the data of others.
- create composite user stories based on interviews with research labs about the service that they would need.
