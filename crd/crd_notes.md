notes on a case study for Curating Research Data: Practical Strategies for Your Digital Repository
==================================================================================================

0. Upload as you go.
1. Building collections with research data is hard
2. Researchers are hard-pressed to gather up and annotate their data for deposit when they are done with it.
3. At the same time, they are already being pushed to take an active approach on data management plans
4. In providing a data management and sharing/reuse platform for video data, we learned early on that collecing this data after the fact was problematic for two reasons
    a. it was difficult to gather it all up
    b. more importantly, it had been collected under an entirely different set of releases
5. Upload as you go is the solution for merging data management with data curation for sharing and discoverability

- would this in anyway be related to the human research subject dimension?
- that is, is the workflow defined by the policy and informed consent requirement?
- how to curate and share human subject data?
- what's the pipeline (starting with getting consent)
