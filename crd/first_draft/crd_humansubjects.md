#title - [dealing with human subjects data]

##INTRODUCTION
- Generic introduction to the concerns of video data and the identifiability of research participants
- By the other edge of this sword is that video data has high potential for reuse.
- Curating research data of this sort, then, is tricky because it's not possible to resolve these problems by redacting or editing this data. It really needs to be stored and made available in its original state.
- That said, we needed to develop a policy and technological framework that supported the various levels of access that would allow us to store datasets in their entirety, while controlling the access to and engendering trust in our data contributors.
- [Also mention stuff about reuse above]

##IRB AND ACCESS CONTROLS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP TO CURATION
- First: needed to define the terms under which the community would access and contribute data (abiding by and providing release levels). With out this, no one would contribute as they would not be ensured that they could maintain their participants consents. 
- Second: Not only are the videos identifiable, but in order for the community to make sense of these assets, they would need a certain amount of metadata (dates of birth), which are extremely important in this field for determining the value of a recorded session. So we needed the policy and technology in place to provide for the necessary description of these assets, or else there would be no reuse.

##WHAT WE DID
###IRB and Access Agreement- policy
- What we did to get this policy nailed down

###TECHNOLOGY - release levels
- What we did to get this technology nailed down

##OUTCOMES
- After a year, this is where we are at
- This is where we are going

##CONCLUSION
- Normal conclusion stuff
