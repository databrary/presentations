1. Databrary Roadmap [KEA]  1:15 
1. Policies [LMS] 1:45 
	- Recap on policies

		+ Authorization was all written here and at PSU--we still need to hear from you about the process
	- Walkthrough
		- Permissions in general, access controls
		- Feedback on permissions
		- 
		- Authorization: requesting and granting
			- lab (only) w/o authorization
			- databrary (only)
			- collaborate w/o authorization
			- proxy
		- How do we make process clear?
			- Affiliates?
	- Report:
		+ IRBs
		- Authorizations
			- NYU, PSU, Indiana, Rutgers, Rochester
			- Discuss authorization process
				- Must researchers check with IRB?

1. Break 2:15
1. Overview of Beta site [Dylan] 2:30 
	- Where we were, where we are
		- 6 months ago
			- Lots of videos
			- Piled up into studies
			- "Static" views, one presentation, limited flexibility
		- identified requirements going forward
			- flexible discovery
			- efficient editing
			- high-level visualizations, summaries
			- api, scripting interface
		- data organization
			- lots of work around grouping data, studies, datasets
			- how much to standardize? later during demo
		- rebuilt more dynamic interface, using API
			- next steps: determine best way to present, browse information
			- next steps: complete, document API
	- Review user stories
		- [slides from before]
			- browsing
			- searching
		- Review data structure
		- Introduction/review of "grouping" records
		- Terminology feedback: dataset/study, record
	- Browser
		- Many ways to group data
			- conditions, exclusions, groups, locations, etc.
			- terminology: feedback, standarization
		- Many ways to display, filter, aggregate data
			- age, sex, release-level
				+ click on age to toggle display
			- race, ethnicity, language
			- ses
		- Going forward, interface for
			- Browsing within a dataset/study
			- Entering data within a dataset
			- Organizing, grouping data
			- Browsing across datasets/studies
	- Future
		- New user stories
			- summarize, aggregate data in study (counts, distributions, etc)
			- enter (type/paste/import) new data, as you go
			- customize presentation of dataset (titles, excerpts, layout)
		- Design sessions
			- Developers, UI/UX experts, researchers
			- Refine user stories, improve interface
		- Databrary 1.0 release
			- Studies and datasets
			- Uploading as you go

1. Researcher asks and support [KEA] 3:30
	- Metadata:
		- Brian MacW's points: Get folk to cough up the data, need some standards
		- Metadata vs coding videos
		- Metadata for participants
		- Metadata for sessions
		- Metadata for studies
		- Metadata for datasets
	- Uploading after the fact	
		- Contributing existing data: Everything researcher does is extra work
			- Existing workflows targeted at publication, not public sharing
		- Necessary, desirable, optional; how good is good enough?
		- Go for low-hanging fruit
			- Displays
			- Excerpts 
	- uploading as you go
		- Critical that researchers upload as they go; what has to happen to make this possible; target date.
		- Upload everything, decide about sharing later.
		- PIs are able
		- Self-curation interface, design, wizard, and customized spreadsheet
	- Data Management
		- Identifying community needs
			- Data Management Specialist
			- PI Interviews
			- Surveys
			- Webinars	
		- Task analysis
			- Understanding research practices/workflow
			- Prioritizing features based on this information
