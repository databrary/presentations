1. The future of Databrary [Dylan and ROG]
	- Short-term future
		- Databrary 1.0 release
			- User guide, videos
			- Search
			- Studies and datasets
	- Open science/data sharing evolving fast
		- What features will attract, keep users, 
		- What features will ensure sustainability, change the culture of dev sci?
	- Longer-term planning (an eye toward sustainability)
		- How does Databrary differ from other services?
			- Social media services
				- ResearchGate
			- Electronic CV/Public profile
				- ResearchGate
				- ORCID
			- Data-sharing
				- For profit: ResearchGate, figshare, 
				- Not-for-profit: Open Science Framework, Dryad, ICPSR, institutional repositories, GitHub
				- University-based vs. non
				- Domain-specific vs. domain general
				- Identifiable data vs. non
			- Data management
				- Open Science Framework
				- GitHub
				- [Quartzy](https://www.quartzy.com/)
				- [LabGuru](http://www.labguru.com/)
		- How _should_ Databrary differ from other services?
			- Should Databrary do more than store data, facilitate data management?
