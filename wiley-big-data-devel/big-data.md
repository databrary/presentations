### Durham Child Health Study
- <http://www.durhamchildstudy.org/>
- "supported by the National Science Foundation (grant #BCS-0126475 and #BCS-0720660). Beginning in August of 2002, approximately 200 families from all walks of life enrolled in this study when their infants were 3-months-old and they were adjusting to the birth of their new child. Before the age of three, we saw infants and their families at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age. With the help of these families, who have shared their thoughts and experiences about parenthood and the many milestones that their infants passed as they transitioned into toddlerhood, we have begun to learn more about the important contributions to their social, emotional, and cognitive development.

Now that the children have made the critical transition into elementary school, we have continued to see them, and their parents, one time during their Kindergarten, First, and Second Grade years. With additional input from their teachers, we are gaining a comprehensive view of how these infants have developed into young children, and the important factors that have shaped who they are."

Hi Rick-

Yes, we do share data from the Durham Child Health and Development Study with the larger research community - however there are some restrictions.  Right now, each person who requests data needs to be "sponsored" by someone who was an original investigator on the study.  This person needs to be involved in the process from start to finish and should also be a co-author on any pubs that come out of it.  We have a process for approval whereby an application is submitted to a committee that must approve the request.  If approved, we require signatures from all collaborators that pertain to data security (where they will save and store data given to them and destroy at end), length of approval (if there is no output (pubs, presentations, prelim data for a grant) within a specified period they can no longer claim those research questions as their own), and all analyses/manuscripts must be approved by the committee before submitting for publication.  

If all of these requirements are agreed upon, then we will share the data.

Does this answer your question? Let me know if you need further details - and I hope this helps. Best, Cathi

international gene environment (gems) consortium, adulthood and aging
psychiatric genetics consortium
this week’s nature genetics, extreme designs

### Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
- "What is the PGC?
The purpose of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) is to conduct mega-analyses of genome-wide genetic data for psychiatric disorders. This website provides information about the organization, implementation, and results of the PGC.

The basic idea is that individual studies are too small to identify robust and replicable associations. Meta-analysis is a widely-used technique that can combine information across studies. We use “mega-analysis” because all of our analyses are based on individual genotype data.

The PGC began in early 2007, and quickly became a confederation of most investigators in the field. The PGC has 500+ investigators from 80+ institutions in 25 countries. There are 170,000+ subjects currently in analysis, and this number is growing rapidly. Thus, the PGC is the largest consortium and the largest biological experiment in the history of psychiatry.

The PGC is passionate about open, inclusive, participatory, and democratic science. Given the importance of the problems we study, we are committed to rapid progress

From 2007-11, the PGC focused on autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. We now include large studies of anorexia nervosa, drug use disorders, OCD/Tourette's, and PTSD. Initially, the PGC focused on common SNPs. Our focus has expanded to include copy number variation and uncommon/rare genetic variation.

The PGC has received funding from many sources. The PGC has relied heavily on the goodwill of its members and their donated effort. Establishing and genotyping the primary studies were funded by a wide range of national, international, and commercial funders. "

### Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), <http://www.teds.ac.uk/>
- "With the help of over 15,000 active families, the Twins Early Development Study is one of the world's premier studies of how genes and environments shape our development from birth to young adulthood. The study is based at King's College London, one of the world's top 25 universities, under the leadership of Professor Robert Plomin"
- "Using birth records of all twins born in England and Wales between 1994 and 1996, the parents of potential participants were contacted and the families invited to take part in the TEDS study. Over 15,000 pairs of twins originally signed up for the study and more than 13,000 pairs remain involved to the present day. Completing studies and questionnaires in person, over the telephone and on the web at roughly yearly intervals throughout their lives so far, these twins and their families are providing incredibly valuable data, providing researchers and academics with a unique insight into child and adolescent development. DNA samples have also been gathered from more than 5,000 pairs of twins and are being used together with the rest of the data in order to gain greater understanding of how genes influence our abilities and behaviours."
- Publication list here <http://www.teds.ac.uk/publications.asp>
- More than 350 publications.
- 100 collaborators
- "Requests for the use of TEDS data will be reviewed by an Executive Committee formed of the TEDS Director, Deputy Director and Data Manager. On initial approval of the broad aims of a proposed research project, a collaborator will be given access to metadata in the form of the data dictionary, and will be asked to submit a formal data request. The data request form asks collaborators to record the precise aims of their planned research, and the variables that they need to satisfy these aims. The Executive Committee will review the data request form, which will generally be approved if the collaborator proposes a novel project that does not overlap with analyses already being planned or carried out by the TEDS research team or other collaborators. Where granted, approval for the use of data by collaborators is for a period of one year only, in order to avoid data being sequestered but not used."

## Twin and Offspring Study in Sweden (TOSS), <http://ki.se/en/meb/twin-offspring-study-in-sweden-toss>
- "Studies that have examined genetic and environmental contributions to measures of family relationships and to associations between family relationships and mental health have found two different patterns of results for adults and children. For children, genetic factors explain most of the covariance between parent-child relationships and child adjustment, while in adults nonshared environmental factors account for most of the covariance between marital relationships and adult adjustment. These different patterns of findings suggest that different mechanisms are involved in linking pertinent family relationships to adjustment in children and adults.
This project extends the Twin Moms Project and includes a sample of twin fathers and their families (N=320 twin pairs and their families) and to collect an additional 250 pairs of twin mothers for a sample of 900 twin parents and their families (total N about 3,000 individuals). This expanded sample enables us to examine whether patterns of genetic and environmental influences on associations between family relationships and women's adjustment also hold for men. We also utilize the full twin families design in an effort to distinguish between different types of genotype-environment correlation for the associations between family relationships and child adjustment. As such, this information will enable us to understand better how and why relationships within the family affect the mental health of family members.
We have collected data on family relationships, including parent-child, marital and siblings, on adult and child mental health, and on the individual attributes of family members. Twin parents, their partner and the target child will participate through questionnaires and an interview, using a multi-agent, multi-method strategy."

### Nonshared Environment in Adolescent Development (NEAD) project, 
- "The Nonshared Environment in Adolescent Development (NEAD) project is a longitudinal study of twins/siblings and parents that has been assessed 3 times: middle adolescence, late adolescence and young adulthood (N=720 families at Time 1). Siblings varied in degree of genetic relatedness including identical twins, fraternal twins, full siblings, half siblings and genetically unrelated (or step) siblings. There were also two family types: nondivorced and step. A multimeasure, multirater approach was taken in NEAD, with data collected from all participants (2 twins or siblings, mother and father) as well as from coded videotaped observations of family interactions. Detailed assessments of family relationships, adolescent adjustment and competence were collected at all 3 times. The original aim of NEAD was to identify systematic sources of nonshared environmental influences that contribute to differences among family members. Although systematic sources of nonshared environmental influences were not found in NEAD, three major sets of findings emerged: (1) genetic influences on family relationships and on associations between family relationships and adolescent adjustment; (2) genetic and environmental influences on adolescent adjustment, comorbidity and stability and change in adolescent adjustment from middle to late adolescence; and (3) genetic influences on relationships outside the family."

## Early Growth and Development Study (EGADS)
- "The Early Growth and Development Study is a prospective adoption study of birth parents, adoptive parents, and adopted children recruited in two cohorts (N = 561 triads). The primary study aims are to examine how family, peer, and contextual processes affect children’s adjustment, and to examine their interplay (mediation, moderation) with genetic influences. Participants were recruited through adoption agencies located throughout the United States following the birth of a child. Assessments are ongoing, in 9-month intervals until the child reaches 3 years of age and in one-year intervals thereafter through age 9. Data collection includes the following primary constructs: child temperament, social behavior, school performance, mental health, and health; birth and adoptive parent personality characteristics, mental health, competence, stress, health, context, substance use, parenting, and marital relations; and pregnancy use of drugs and maternal stress during pregnancy. DNA and salivary cortisol samples have also been collected. Analyses have indicated evidence for genotype-environment interactions during early childhood. Study procedures, sample representativeness (including tests of potential confounds in the adoption design), and an overview of findings to date are summarized, and future plans are described." 

### National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), <https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy79>
- The NLSY79 Cohort is a longitudinal project that follows the lives of a sample of American youth born between 1957-64. The cohort originally included 12,686 respondents ages 14-22 when first interviewed in 1979; after two subsamples were dropped, 9,964 respondents remain in the eligible samples. Data are now available from Round 1 (1979 survey year) to Round 25 (2012 survey year).
- NORC runs survey
- "During each survey round, NORC attempts to reach all youth within the active samples.  No respondents have been routinely excluded from locating efforts with the exception of respondents who have died or, in a small number of cases, were judged to be extremely difficult.  The permanent NLSY79 sample designated for interviewing during the 1979-84 interview years consisted of all civilian and military youth who were interviewed in the base year and who were alive at the survey date."
- Increasingly telephone-based, "In early rounds telephone contact to complete the survey occurred under certain circumstances, such as 1987 when funding restrictions limited in-person interviews, or in any year, when the respondent resided in a remote area or field staff determined that phone contact was the preferred method of interviewing a respondent.  Through the years respondents have become more dispersed or expressed a preference for phone interviews.  In response the number of telephone interviews increased greatly beginning in 2002 and is now the main mode of interviewing.  The percent of surveys conducted by telephone for each survey year are shown in Table 1."
- "Geographic information about NLSY79 respondents is available only to researchers who are designated agents of BLS.  These researchers must agree in writing to adhere to the BLS confidentiality policy, and their projects must further the mission of BLS and the NLSY79 program to conduct sound, legitimate research in the social sciences.  Applicants must provide a clear statement of their research methodology and objectives and explain how the geographic variables are necessary to meet those objectives.  For more information about obtaining access to geographic variables in the NLSY79, see the NLS Web site at www.bls.gov/nls."

### Great Smoky Mountains Study of Youth
- "The Great Smoky Mountains Study of youth focuses on the relationship between the development of psychiatric disorder and the need for and use of mental health services. METHODS:
A multistage, overlapping cohorts design was used, in which 4500 of the 11758 children aged 9, 11, and 13 years in an 11-county area of the southeastern United States were randomly selected for screening for psychiatric symptoms. Children who scored in the top 25% on the screening questionnaire, together with a 1 in 10 random sample of the rest, were recruited for 4 waves of intensive, annual interviews (n = 1015 at wave 1). In a parallel study, all American Indian children aged 9, 11, and 13 years were recruited (N = 323 at wave 1). RESULTS: The 3-month prevalence (+/-SE) of any DSM-III-R axis I disorder in the main sample, weighted to reflect population prevalence rates, was 20.3% +/- 1.7%. The most common diagnoses were anxiety disorders (5.7% +/- 1.0%), enuresis (5.1% +/- 1.0%), tic disorders (4.2% +/- 0.9%), conduct disorder (3.3% +/- 0.6%), oppositional defiant disorder (2.7% +/- 0.4%), and hyperactivity (1.9% +/- 0.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of psychiatric disorder in this rural sample was similar to rates reported in other recent studies. Poverty was the strongest demographic correlate of diagnosis, in both urban and rural children."
- <https://devepi.duhs.duke.edu/gsms.html>
- Focus on measures development: "A major goal of our research has included the development, validation, production, and dissemination of qualitative assessment measures to further the advancement of mental health research. A suite of interviews have been developed that employ a consistent approach to the assessment of psychopathology in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. The first of these interviews to be developed (beginning in 1986) was the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA) which collects information from children and adolescents aged 9-18 and their parents. The first edition of the CAPA was developed at the Institute of Psychiatry in London. It has been updated and modified repeatedly since 1986 by the Developmental Epidemiology Program at Duke. A version of the CAPA for use in twin studies (which includes lifetime assessments for some disorders) was produced by the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavior and Development in 1992. The first edition of the Young Adult Psychiatric Assessment (YAPA) was produced by the Developmental Epidemiology program at Duke in 1998. Work on the first edition of the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) was begun in the fall of 1998, and the first edition was finalized during the summer of 1999.
         In addition to these assessments of psychopathology, the Developmental Epidemiology Program has also produced companion measures to assess service use in children, adolescents and young adults (the Child and Adolescent Services Assessment - CASA), and the impact of children’s psychiatric problems on parental and family life (the Child and Adolescent Impact Assessment - CAIA)."
- Unclear whether data are shared or archived.

## Early Childhood Longitudinal Program (ECLS), <https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/>
- "The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) program includes three longitudinal studies that examine child development, school readiness, and early school experiences. The birth cohort of the ECLS-B is a sample of children born in 2001 and followed from birth through kindergarten entry. The kindergarten class of 1998-99 cohort is a sample of children followed from kindergarten through the eighth grade. The kindergarten class of 2010-11 cohort is following a sample of children from kindergarten through the fifth grade.

The ECLS program provides national data on children's status at birth and at various points thereafter; children's transitions to nonparental care, early education programs, and school; and children's experiences and growth through the eighth grade. The ECLS program also provides data to analyze the relationships among a wide range of family, school, community, and individual variables with children's development, early learning, and performance in school.

ECLS-K:2011 Update

Restricted-use and public-use files containing data from the kindergarten and first-grade rounds of data collection for the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (ECLS-K:2011) are now available. Please note that while the ECLS-K:2011 was designed to allow for cross-cohort comparisons with the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998–99 (ECLS-K), the direct child cognitive assessment scores available on these files are not directly comparable to scores from the ECLS-K. Child assessment scores designed specifically for comparisons between the ECLS-K and ECLS-K:2011 cohorts are currently in development, with an anticipated release in the fall of 2015. It is appropriate to use data from the current data file release to compare the two cohorts in other ways, for example to look at differences in demographic characteristics or the home, school, and classroom experiences of the two groups."

## Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), <http://www.childmind.org/en/healthy-brain-network/abide/>
- Shared by application on LONI. And via INDI Summer of Sharing, <http://www.childmind.org/en/summer-sharing/>
- "Despite significant advances in understanding the neurobiological basis of autism apectrum disorders in the past 20 years, studies have been limited by clinical heterogeneity, variability in methodological approaches, and small sample sizes. While laboratories around the world are actively collecting functional and structural MRI datasets to examine the neural basis of autism, no one laboratory can obtain a dataset large enough to comprehensively appreciate the neural signatures of the disorder. As demonstrated by the success of the ADHD-200 consortium and its open data release through INDI, the sharing and pooling of data resources across laboratories can help overcome these challenges and rapidly accelerate the pace imaging research. 
Building upon the ADHD-200 model, Drs. Adriana Di Martino (NYU Child Study Center) and Stewart Mostofsky (Kennedy Krieger Institute) have assembled an international consortium dedicated to the sharing of resting state functional imaging and morphometric data for autism. Already with more than 15 contributing sites, this effort has come to be known as the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), and promises to deliver more than one thousand datasets for the study of human brain function and structure in autism. Dr. Michael Milham and his team at the Child Mind Institute Center for the Developing Brain are overseeing the aggregation and sharing of ABIDE datasets through INDI. The ABIDE data is scheduled to be released during the INDI 2012 Summer of Sharing. The ABIDE consortium will also work to provide an initial demonstration of the feasibility and utility of analyzing the large-scale, multisite ABIDE dataset."

## Brain Genomics Superstruct Project

- <http://neuroinformatics.harvard.edu/gsp/>
- Stored on Dataverse, <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/GSP>
- "Genetic factors have been known to play a role in the development of autism, but the contribution of common genetic variations — those that crop up in at least 1 percent of the general population — to the disorder is not known. Randy Buckner and his colleagues at Harvard University developed a new, highly efficient approach to explore the effects of these variations on brain functions associated with autism.

Many of the hundreds of genes involved in brain development have common variations that presumably contribute to the typical diversity found in the general population. Buckner and his colleagues hypothesize that genetic predisposition to autism occurs when brain development is steered down an abnormal path through the combined influence of dozens — or even hundreds — of common variants, each with a small role. To determine the role of such variations in autism, Buckner and his team explored typical development and looked at parents of individuals with autism.

Data from a recently developed imaging tool called functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging, or fcMRI, were collected for more than 3,000 typically developing individuals. These data allow researchers to examine basic properties of brain organization — such as which hemisphere is dominant for language, and whether typical connectivity patterns are present in brain systems used for thinking — and link differences in these properties to specific genetic variants.

Buckner and his colleagues have dubbed their effort the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project, as it builds on, or ‘superstructs,’ the collective foundation laid by previous work on autism, including the ongoing data samples collected through the Simons Simplex Collection. The team shared their rapid fcMRI protocol, which eases the burden of data acquisition by capturing imaging data in less than 15 minutes per participant. The researchers are also sharing the structural and functional MRI data collected through their project."

### Colorado Adoption Project (CAP)
- "This paper describes the Colorado Adoption Project (CAP), an ongoing genetically informative longitudinal study of behavioral development. We describe the features of the adoption design used in CAP, and discuss how this type of design uses data from both parent-offspring and related- versus unrelated-sibling comparisons to estimate the importance of genetic and shared environmental influences for resemblance among family members. The paper provides an overview of CAP's history, how subjects were ascertained, recruited, and retained, and the domains of assessment that have been explored since the CAP's initiation in 1975. Findings from some representative papers that make use of data from CAP participants illustrate the study's multifaceted nature as a parent-offspring and sibling behavioral genetic study, a study that parallels a complimentary twin study, a longitudinal study of development, a source of subjects for molecular genetic investigation, and a study of the outcomes of the adoption process itself. As subjects assessed first at age 1 approach age 40, we hope the CAP will establish itself as the first prospective adoption study of lifespan development."

### The International Study of Childhood Obesity, Lifestyle and the Environment (ISCOLE), <http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/13/900>
- "Background
The primary aim of the International Study of Childhood Obesity, Lifestyle and the Environment (ISCOLE) was to determine the relationships between lifestyle behaviours and obesity in a multi-national study of children, and to investigate the influence of higher-order characteristics such as behavioural settings, and the physical, social and policy environments, on the observed relationships within and between countries.

Methods/design
The targeted sample included 6000 10-year old children from 12 countries in five major geographic regions of the world (Europe, Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific). The protocol included procedures to collect data at the individual level (lifestyle, diet and physical activity questionnaires, accelerometry), family and neighborhood level (parental questionnaires), and the school environment (school administrator questionnaire and school audit tool). A standard study protocol was developed for implementation in all regions of the world. A rigorous system of training and certification of study personnel was developed and implemented, including web-based training modules and regional in-person training meetings."

## From Susan McHale

Hi Rick, Not sure what you mean by "Big"--my sense is that the population studies like Ad Health are considered "large" but not "big."  If you want other population studies there are many, including NHANES, NLSY, Health and Retirement Study, Panel Study on Income Dynamics, Early Childhood Longitudinal Study,and the American Community Survey (census data).
PRI has a "curator" of its data set holdings-- I can e-introduce you and perhaps she can send a list.
On Ad Health, in addition to the broad substantive focus and longitudinal design, focus on adolescence and young adulthood which were understudied by population researchers, data are multi-modal(parent and youth report; school and related geographic data, biomarkers).  Perhaps most importantly, regular trainings were held on the data set (not sure if these are still going on)--there was actual effort to help investigators use the data--not just throw it out and hope. THese are just my opinions, of course.

## [The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm)
- is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations.
- Data back to 1959 under NHES I-
- Infancy to 74
- The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the country, 15 of which are visited each year.
- The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personn
- Demographics, dietary intake, blood test data, questionnaire, 
- Those are important questions that your doctor can answer, using the growth charts developed by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The NHANES growth charts

        + "Abstract
OBJECTIVE:
We evaluated whether regional differences in physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) existed along language boundaries within Switzerland and whether potential differences would be explained by socio-demographics or environmental characteristics.
METHODS:
We combined data of 611 children aged 4 to 7 years from four regional studies. PA and SB were assessed by accelerometers. Information about the socio-demographic background was obtained by questionnaires. Objective neighbourhood attributes could be linked to home addresses. Multivariate regression models were used to test associations between PA and SB and socio-demographic characteristics and neighbourhood attributes.
RESULTS:
Children from the German compared to the French-speaking region were more physically active and less sedentary (by 10-15 %, p < 0.01). Although German-speaking children lived in a more favourable environment and a higher socioeconomic neighbourhood (differences p < 0.001), these characteristics did not explain the differences in PA behaviour between French and German speaking.
CONCLUSIONS:
Factors related to the language region, which might be culturally rooted were among the strongest correlates of PA and SB among Swiss children, independent of individual, social and environmental factors."
