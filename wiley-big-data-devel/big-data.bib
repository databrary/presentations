  abstract = {The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.},

  issn = {0146-0404},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine population age norms in the first three years of life for binocular and monocular grating visual acuity (VA) obtained with Vistech-Teller Acuity Cards (TAC).
METHODS: TAC was used to estimate grating acuity in 646 healthy infants and children born at due date +/- 2 weeks, all of whom underwent ophthalmologic and orthoptic evaluation. The sample consisted of 20 age groups from 0 to 36 months. Sixty-nine percent of the children attended day care centers in the city of São Paulo. The sample was composed of white (63.0\%), mulatto (25.2\%), African-Brazilian (11.0\%), and Asian (0.8\%) infants and children, most of whom (97\%) were from low-income families. Tests were conducted by eight highly trained testers, six of whom were orthoptists.
RESULTS: Binocular and monocular norms for grating VA are presented in terms of tolerance limits for 90\% of the population with 95\% probability. The range of tolerance limits is approximately 2.5 octaves at most ages. There were no statistical differences among scores obtained by the different testers. There were no differences in VA due to race, sex, and first or second eye tested. The results on binocular (99.3\%) and monocular (96.2\%) testability and on mean test duration (13 minutes for one binocular and two monocular measurements) confirm the clinical applicability of TAC.
CONCLUSIONS: The binocular and monocular grating VA norms obtained in this large-sample study are different from the preliminary norms published with the TAC. Results from this and other studies (see Mayer et al, page 671, this issue) strongly point to a need for redefinition of the preliminary VA norms.},

  issn = {0146-0404},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To derive norms for monocular grating acuity and interocular acuity differences that are appropriate for clinical applications using the acuity card procedure (ACP) and Teller Acuity Cards (TAC).
METHODS: Monocular acuities were measured in 460 children in 12 age groups between 1 month and 4 years. Inclusion criteria were term birth, good general health and normal development, normal eyes, and cycloplegic refraction within specific limits. Each child was tested by two ACP testers who were aware of TAC spatial frequency but not grating location during testing.
RESULTS: Three monocular tests were completed in the first session in 99\% of children. Median time to complete the tests of both eyes ranged from 3.2 to 8.4 minutes. Monocular acuity norms were calculated using 95\% and 99\% prediction limits. The new norms spanned higher spatial frequencies than the preliminary ACP norms between ages 1 month and 18 months but were similar between 24 and 36 months. The lower normal 2.5\% limits were similar to lower limits of other normative studies. The interocular acuity difference was zero or 0.5 octave in 99\% of subjects of all ages. Acuities obtained by the same tester on different days and by different testers on the same day were within 0.5 octave in at least 90\% of subjects, comparable to previous studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides monocular acuity norms that are appropriate for clinical settings in which the ACP and TAC are used and should replace the preliminary ACP norms.},

  volume = {116},
  issn = {1098-4275},
  doi = {10.1542/peds.2005-0173},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (BSID II) are commonly used to assess outcomes of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. We sought to assess the predictive validity of the BSID II Mental Developmental Index (MDI) for cognitive function at school age.
DESIGN/METHODS: Of 330 ELBW infants admitted in 1992-1995, 238 (72\%) survived to the age of 8 years, of whom 200 (84\%) were tested at both 20 months' corrected age (CA) and 8 years. Mean birth weight was 811 g, mean gestational age was 26.4 weeks, 41\% were boys, and 60\% were black. Measures included the BSID II at 20 months' CA and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC) Mental Processing Composite (MPC) at 8 years' postnatal age. BSID II MDI and MPC scores were compared and the predictive validity calculated for all 200 ELBW children and for the 154 ELBW neurosensory-intact subgroup. Predictors of stability or change in cognitive scores were examined via logistic regression adjusting for gender and sociodemographic status.
RESULTS: For all ELBW children, the mean MDI was 75.6 +/- 16 versus a mean KABC of 87.8 +/- 19. For the neurosensory-intact subgroup, the mean MDI was 79.3 +/- 16 and the mean KABC was 92.3 +/- 15. Rates of cognitive impairment, defined as an MDI or KABC of {\textless}70, dropped from 39\% at 20 months' CA to 16\% at 8 years for the total ELBW population and from 29\% to 7\% for the neurosensory-intact subgroup. The positive predictive value of having an MPC of {\textless}70 given an MDI of {\textless}70 was 0.37 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27, 0.49) for all ELBW infants, 0.20 (95\% CI: 0.10, 0.35) for the neurosensory-intact subgroup, and 0.61 (95\% CI: 0.42, 0.77) for the neurosensory-impaired subgroup. The negative predictive values were 0.98, 0.99, and 0.85 for the 3 groups, respectively. Neurosensory impairment at 20 months' CA predicted lack of improvement of cognitive function (odds ratio: 6.9; 95\% CI: 2.4, 20.2). Children whose cognitive scores improved between 20 months and 8 years had significantly better school performance than those whose scores stayed at {\textless}70, but they did less well than those whose scores were persistently {\textgreater}70.
CONCLUSIONS: The predictive validity of a subnormal MDI for cognitive function at school age is poor but better for ELBW children who have neurosensory impairments. We are concerned that decisions to provide intensive care for ELBW infants in the delivery room might be biased by reported high rates of cognitive impairments based on the use and presumptive validity of the BSID II MDI.},

The resulting time-lapse “movies” reveal that (i) higher-order association cortices mature only after lower-order somatosensory and visual cortices, the functions of which they integrate, are developed, and (ii) phylogenetically older brain areas mature earlier than newer ones. Direct comparison with normal cortical development may help understanding of some neurodevelopmental disorders such as childhood-onset schizophrenia or autism.},

  abstract = {Using a population-based sampling strategy, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Normal Brain Development compiled a longitudinal normative reference database of neuroimaging and correlated clinical/behavioral data from a demographically representative sample of healthy children and adolescents aged newborn through early adulthood. The present paper reports brain volume data for 325 children, ages 4.5–18 years, from the first cross-sectional time point. Measures included volumes of whole-brain gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), left and right lateral ventricles, frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobe GM and WM, subcortical GM (thalamus, caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus), cerebellum, and brainstem. Associations with cross-sectional age, sex, family income, parental education, and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated. Key observations are: 1) age-related decreases in lobar GM most prominent in parietal and occipital cortex; 2) age-related increases in lobar WM, greatest in occipital, followed by the temporal lobe; 3) age-related trajectories predominantly curvilinear in females, but linear in males; and 4) small systematic associations of brain tissue volumes with BMI but not with IQ, family income, or parental education. These findings constitute a normative reference on regional brain volumes in children and adolescents.},

  abstract = {The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), 1994-2008 [Public Use] is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades 7-12 in the United States during the 1994-1995 school year. The Add Health cohort has been followed into young adulthood with four in-home interviews, the most recent in 2008, when the sample was aged 24-32. Add Health combines longitudinal survey data on respondents' social, economic, psychological and physical well-being with contextual data on the family, neighborhood, community, school, friendships, peer groups, and romantic relationships, providing unique opportunities to study how social environments and behaviors in adolescence are linked to health and achievement outcomes in young adulthood.

Public use biomarker data has been added. The Glucose/HbA1c data file contains two measures of glucose homeostasis based on assays of the Wave IV dried blood spots: Glucose (mg/dl) and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, \%). Six additional constructed measures -- fasting duration, classification of fasting glucose, classification of non-fasting glucose, classification of HbA1c, diabetes medication, and a joint classification of glucose, HbA1c, self-reported history of diabetes, and anti-diabetic medication use -- are also included.

Public use Lipids biomarker data has been added. The Lipids data file contains measures of triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total-cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, self-reported antihyperlipidemic medication use, joint classification of self-reported history of hyperlipidemia and antihyperlipidemic medication use, fasting duration.},

The study of neurostructural development or neurofunctional development has been hampered by the lack of age-appropriate MRI reference volumes. This causes misspecification of segmented data, irregular registrations, and the absence of appropriate stereotaxic volumes. We have created the “Neurodevelopmental MRI Database” that provides age-specific reference data from 2 weeks through 89 years of age. The data are presented in fine-grained ages (e.g., 3 months intervals through 1 year; 6 months intervals through 19.5 years; 5 year intervals from 20 through 89 years). The base component of the database at each age is an age-specific average MRI template. The average MRI templates are accompanied by segmented partial volume estimates for segmenting priors, and a common stereotaxic atlas for infant, pediatric, and adult participants. The database is available online (http://jerlab.psych.sc.edu/NeurodevelopmentalMRIDatabase/).},

  abstract = {Rethinking Innateness asks the question, "What does it really mean to say that a behavior is innate?" The authors describe a new framework in which interactions, occurring at all levels, give rise to emergent forms and behaviors. These outcomes often may be highly constrained and universal, yet are not themselves directly contained in the genes in any domain-specific way.One of the key contributions of Rethinking Innateness is a taxonomy of ways in which a behavior can be innate. These include constraints at the level of representation, architecture, and timing; typically, behaviors arise through the interaction of constraints at several of these levels.The ideas are explored through dynamic models inspired by a new kind of "developmental connectionism," a marriage of connectionist models and developmental neurobiology, forming a new theoretical framework for the study of behavioral development. While relying heavily on the conceptual and computational tools provided by connectionism, Rethinking Innateness also identifies ways in which these tools need to be enriched by closer attention to biology.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic or resting state functional connectivity MRI and structural covariance MRI have begun to reveal the adult human brain's multiple network architectures. How and when these networks emerge during development remains unclear, but understanding ontogeny could shed light on network function and dysfunction. In this study, we applied structural covariance MRI techniques to 300 children in four age categories (early childhood, 5–8 y; late childhood, 8.5–11 y; early adolescence, 12–14 y; late adolescence, 16–18 y) to characterize gray matter structural relationships between cortical nodes that make up large-scale functional networks. Network nodes identified from eight widely replicated functional intrinsic connectivity networks served as seed regions to map whole-brain structural covariance patterns in each age group. In general, structural covariance in the youngest age group was limited to seed and contralateral homologous regions. Networks derived using primary sensory and motor cortex seeds were already well-developed in early childhood but expanded in early adolescence before pruning to a more restricted topology resembling adult intrinsic connectivity network patterns. In contrast, language, social–emotional, and other cognitive networks were relatively undeveloped in younger age groups and showed increasingly distributed topology in older children. The so-called default-mode network provided a notable exception, following a developmental trajectory more similar to the primary sensorimotor systems. Relationships between functional maturation and structural covariance networks topology warrant future exploration.},

  shorttitle = {The {Ontogeny} of {Information}},
  abstract = {The Ontogeny of Information is a critical intervention into the ongoing and perpetually troubling nature-nurture debates surrounding human development. Originally published in 1985, this was a foundational text in what is now the substantial field of developmental systems theory. In this revised edition Susan Oyama argues compellingly that nature and nurture are not alternative influences on human development but, rather, developmental products and the developmental processes that produce them. Information, says Oyama, is thought to reside in molecules, cells, tissues, and the environment. When something wondrous occurs in the world, we tend to question whether the information guiding the transformation was pre-encoded in the organism or installed through experience or instruction. Oyama looks beyond this either-or question to focus on the history of such developments. She shows that what developmental “information” does depends on what is already in place and what alternatives are available. She terms this process “constructive interactionism,” whereby each combination of genes and environmental influences simultaneously interacts to produce a unique result. Ontogeny, then, is the result of dynamic and complex interactions in multileveled developmental systems. The Ontogeny of Information challenges specialists in the fields of developmental biology, philosophy of biology, psychology, and sociology, and even nonspecialists, to reexamine the existing nature-nurture dichotomy as it relates to the history and formation of organisms.},

Participants then video recorded their teaching and self-evaluated this performance. Results indicated that the introduction of video models reduced inflation of scores in self-evaluation and enhanced candidates' understanding of the expectations for the performance assessment of teaching.

The task involved producing a video of the groups' explanation to a problem using a mobile device. Applying methods from interaction analysis we examine how the group accomplishes and performs conceptual understanding. The analysis shows the indexical affordances of video as medium in the setting, allowing students to use the exhibit as a visual and physical prop in the film to explain scientific concepts. Moreover, we found that the students' conceptual work was conducted in advance of making the video, and that making the video entailed collaboratively actualizing understandings previously accomplished in the group. Based on our findings, we propose that video tasks may be a productive way to ‚Äòframe topics‚Äô and orient students to disciplinary aspects of museum exhibits. "
