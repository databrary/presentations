The need for an integrative model that meets diverse learning objectives and competences led to a study on how to effectively use videos to guide student-teachers towards professional development. The analysis of case studies helped develop a four-pronged holistic proposal that places student-teachers in the role of both teacher and learner allowing the co-construction of teaching knowledge and the acquisition of digital competences and media literacy. This article outlines the pedagogical scheme and provides qualified evidence that supports arguments for its basis. "

This was examined by providing video models along with evaluation rubrics that represented desired performance standard to one group of pre-service teacher candidates, while another group was provided the descriptions of these lessons and corresponding evaluation rubrics. Participants then video recorded their teaching and self-evaluated this performance. Results indicated that the introduction of video models reduced inflation of scores in self-evaluation and enhanced candidates' understanding of the expectations for the performance assessment of teaching.

The task involved producing a video of the groups' explanation to a problem using a mobile device. Applying methods from interaction analysis we examine how the group accomplishes and performs conceptual understanding. The analysis shows the indexical affordances of video as medium in the setting, allowing students to use the exhibit as a visual and physical prop in the film to explain scientific concepts. Moreover, we found that the students' conceptual work was conducted in advance of making the video, and that making the video entailed collaboratively actualizing understandings previously accomplished in the group. Based on our findings, we propose that video tasks may be a productive way to ‚Äòframe topics‚Äô and orient students to disciplinary aspects of museum exhibits. "
