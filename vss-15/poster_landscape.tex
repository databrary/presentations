%%% The only inconvenience is that you can only specify a relative position

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      The open sharing of data and workflows from scientific research has gained increasing attention in many fields and has become a priority for research funders. 
      Databrary (databrary.org) is a digital data library specialized for storing and sharing video and research data and metadata. Vision scientists often present temporally varying visual displays to human or non-human animal observers and may collect gaze position, kinematic data, or other physiological recordings simultaneously. 
      Some vision scientists collect identifiable video recordings of participants for use in off-line tagging or coding. 
      Databrary may be especially well suited for these use cases because of the library's focus on uploading, organizing, storing, and sharing research data and metadata collected in the course of behavioral research.
      Databrary has developed policies that enable identifiable information to be shared with the permission of research participants.

  \headerbox{Privacy \& Security}{name=privacy,column=0,row=1, below=problem}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      Videos may contain identifiable information such as faces, voices, and images of places. 
      Databrary ensures that identifiable information can be shared in two ways:
      \begin{description}
      \item[Restricting Access:]
      Only those with independent researcher status at an institution may be granted authorized investigator status.
      Applicants promise to uphold ethical principles and sign an access agreement, which must be co-signed by their institution.

      \item[Securing Permission to Share:]
      Identifiable data may only be shared if participants have given permission.
      Databrary has developed a release template for obtaining informed consent for sharing identifiable data.
      The Databrary release template may be adapted for specific research protocols.

      \end{description}

  \headerbox{What Can Be Shared}{name=shared,column=1,row=0}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Databrary can house video, audio, PDF, spreadsheet, image, and text-based files along with associated metadata and annotations.
    Video files are transcoded into standard, HTML5-compatible formats, currently H.264+AAC in MP4. Databrary stores other data in native formats (e.g., .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .csv, .pdf, .jpg, .png).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Databrary is built on PostreSQL using the Scala Play framework and AngularJS.
    Data are preserved indefinitely in a secure data storage facility at NYU. 
    There is no cost to use the system; a sustainability model is under development.
    All code is GPL on GitHub.
