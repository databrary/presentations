\begin{abstract}
Video and audio recordings serve as a primary data source in many fields, especially in the social and behavioral sciences.
Recordings present unique opportunities for reuse and reanalysis for novel scientific purposes.
Databrary provides a web-based service for sharing and reusing the video data created by researchers in the developmental and learning sciences.
By investigating how researchers organize, analyze, and mine their own recordings, we have implemented a system that empowers researchers to capture, store, and share recordings in a standardized way.
This demo will take a tour through the Databrary service, hightlighting how it controls user access to restricted data based on human research subjects, how it facilitates browsing and discoverability of datasets, and how it provides a service for researchers to upload and manage their data as they collect it.

\section{Introduction/Background}

Video and audio recordings serve as a primary data source for scientific research in psychology, linguistics, education, anthropology, and many other disciplines.
They are, in contrast to most timeseries data, human-consumable and largely self-documenting, and are often analyzed without the use of sophisticated tools, as human observers can directly glean much of the data's richness.
This allows recordings collected in one context to be used by others for different purposes with minimal explanation, naturally reducing the problems of documentation, provenance, formatting, and access that plague many research repositories.

Unfortunately, researchers rarely share recordings with others, due largely to entrenched practices and perceived privacy requirements.
%something here or somewhere else about aversion (fear) to changing practices...
Despite their inherent reusability, this lack of sharing inhibits the reuse of recordings and impedes scientific discovery.
To address this problem, the Databrary project\footnote{https://databrary.org/} aims to build tools and policies that facilitate repurposing and reuse of recordings without placing undue burden on data contributors.
We have created a web-based data library to store and organize recordings and to capture contextual information necessary for reuse in standardized ways, allowing for understanding and discovery.

Our approach is to focus on video and audio recordings in particular research domains, and build appropriate structured and unstructured resources around this functional core.
We designed the system by investigating how researchers studying human development and education organize their own data, deriving from those observations a unifying set of principles for organizing contextual metadata.
This facilitates the capture, standardization, discovery, and understanding of data to enable reuse of recordings at an unprecedented scale.
We achieve this conformance through in-depth, investigative curation of previously collected datasets, along with user interfaces allowing researchers to upload their own research data as they acquire it.
In the future, we hope to capture the additional annotation data researchers already produce while analyzing recordings to further improve our discovery capabilities.

\subsection*{Repository Overview}

Databrary began accepting contributions in early 2014 and opened for general use in October 2014.
It currently hosts 5,700 video files totaling 1,600 hours of recordings along with 2,200 additional files.
These files make up 2,400 sessions and are covered by 1,300 metadata records (including 1,100 individual participants).
Data originates from 35 individual contributors across 25 different universities.

Databrary is a new, open-source web application\footnote{http://github.com/databrary/databrary}, built in Scala on the Play Framework\footnote{http://playframework.com/} to support a responsive user interface, a complete API, and high-performance streaming.
Recordings and other files are placed in content-based filesystem storage, and all structured data are stored in a PostgreSQL database, leveraging its geometric indexing capabilities for temporal data.
All uploaded recordings are automatically transcoded to a standard format to enable cross-platform HTML5-based streaming and downloading for off-line access, currently H.264/AAC in an MPEG-4 container for video.
This transcoding utilizes the high performance computing cluster at the host campus of New York University, using ffmpeg's libav bindings for both this and direct access to video frames and clips.
The user interface is built primarily on the Angular web framework\footnote{http://angularjs.org/}, and all data access is performed through an open JSON API.

\section{Designated Community}

Focus on a particular research domain allows us to achieve a sustainable balance between standardization and flexibility without burdening contributors.
The success we've had in engaging, involving, and extracting data from researchers is due largely to our focus on a specific community, but it has come at the cost of limitations in scope and difficulties of interoperability and discovery that many more traditional repositories avoid.
By slowly growing our scope and relaxing some of these limitations, we hope to leverage more of the established knowledge of the digital library community in order to make this repository more globally applicable to the storage and accessibility of research data.

\section{Interface}

\subsection{Normalization}

We have adopted an approach that encourages adherence to existing standardized options but still allows new types to be created as the data require it.
Initially we have achieved this through manual review and off-line curation of contributions, dynamically extending the system as new types of data were discovered without burdening or constraining researchers.
However, since we expect the bulk of the data in the library to come from newly collected sources (due largely to privacy constraints on existing datasets), we have additionally taken a distinct, user-driven approach.

While some researchers in our target domains have standardized data management practices, a large majority have no special data management or collection tools.
Most use a combination of hand-written paper, simple spreadsheets, existing video annotation tools, statistical analysis software, and local filesystem storage.
This suggested the opportunity to supply a cohesive data management platform where all collected raw data---including recordings, contextual information, and measurements---could be entered, stored, and exported for later off-line analysis.
Providing a targeted user interface to meet the existing and evolving needs of our contributed data allows us to control the means of data entry and thus achieve a greater amount of normalization in the data from the outset, through liberal use of visualization, auto-completion, and suggestions.
In turn, this adds convenience and functionality for researchers over existing practices while alleviating storage burdens.

\subsection{Discovery}

While increased normalization facilitates filtering and targeted searches for data, the general problems of browsing and discovery remain largely unsolved.
This problem is compounded for us because we expect data collected in one research area to be useful for entirely different purposes.
That is, data arrives labeled with contextual information that may not fully describe the range of features present.
Ultimately, determining usefulness requires direct, human observation of the recordings, and so a large part the discovery solution will be simply to present researchers with short, representative samples from a variety of datasets.

Another important source for search targets comes from annotations supplied by the original researchers during analysis, as well as by the community.
We are currently working to support import and export workflows for existing annotation tools that add meaningful definitions to these often opaque codes, while allowing researchers to continue their current practices.
Beyond that, we also plan to build a new, more efficient and structured annotation web interface supporting more of the analysis workflow directly within our system.
In this way, Databrary will allow researchers to work with their recordings directly in raw form without having to transfer or transform them, while also capturing more meaningful and standardized contextual information from this process.
