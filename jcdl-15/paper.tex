%%dg being that the conference them is big data, should we be trying to be more explicit about that?
% big data is generally referring to "more rows" rather than larger files. I think the closest we get is the size of video files
% which is already noted below. Just wondering if it makes sense to be more explicit or not.
%%dg also preservation and discoverability - though maybe that's included in data management

\section{Introduction}

%%dg maybe break this part up into subsections: Content/Domain; Users; Design contraints; Approach (or something like that)

Video and audio recordings play a key role in many areas of human research, particularly in psychology, linguistics, education, and ethnography.
It can document experimental procedures or behaviors, convey ideas and examples in teaching and scientific communication, and often act primary data source for later analysis.
Unfortunately, in standard practice, the use of these video data is isolated to the researchers who collected them, due largely to the perceived requirements around privacy restrictions.
The goal of the Databrary project is to establish policies and tools to allow video data to be documented, organized, and shared so that other researchers can discover and re-purpose existing videos for their own research interest.
Accordingly, Databrary, with an initial focus on developmental psychology research, has created a web-based library to accommodate the storage and organization of video data, capture contextual information necessary for re-use, and standardize across datasets without placing undue burden on data contributors.

% this is questionable...
Most existing research data repositories provide either unstructured storage of arbitrary files, or have rigorously structured schema that require contributors to properly extract and format contributions.
%%dg should pick examples to illustrate both sides of the spectrum (ICPSR - ???)
While the former is well suited for archival of entire datasets and general-purpose hosting of resources, it does not facilitate detailed search, understanding, or re-use across various datasets.
The latter, on the other hand, generate large-scale, homogeneous data sources for meta- and re-analysis, but limited to specific domains and research questions, losing the full richness, context, and innovation of the source materials and field.
We have attempted to strike a balance between these extremes by focusing on video and audio recordings as the unifying factor and allowing additional resources to be built and discovered around this core.

%%dg perhaps better to frame below as the affordances and challenges of working with video data. 
%That is..."A key component to understanding the design decisions made in creating Databrary is the unique affordances and challenges of video and audio data"
%Affordances
We have intentionally chosen to limit the bulk of the data hosted in the library to human-consumable, self-documenting, timeseries data: video and audio recordings.
These data can and largely are consumed and analyzed, at least initially, without sophisticated analysis tools: once digitally decoded, humans can glean the bulk of the richness of such data directly.
Similarly, these data can often be used on their own or with minimal explanation, as the nature of the subjects and activity are readily apparent.
This naturally aids in the problems of documentation and re-use that plague most flat-file or dense datasets.
%Challenges
On the other hand, since automated analysis of videos is an active yet immature research area, the problems of search, discoverability, and meta-analysis over these media remain.
We attempt to address these issues by augmenting the primary recording data with additional structured and unstructured features.
%%dg probably need to make this section more cohesive, but the main gist is 1) We focus on video data, 2)video data has these inherent challenges. 3) At the same time there are already challenges involved in creating a research data repository, independant of the format of the data travels on. 4) This paper dicusses the challenges we have resolved and the challenges we have coming up.

Databrary can incorporate heterogeneous datasets within our target domain by allowing secondary, general-purpose flat-file data, materials, and references to be associated with the primary data.
This facilitates storage and retrieval of data more closely mapped to the original context in which it was collected and analyzed.
At the same time, it provides a common, standard structure for recordings and their associated metadata, including context, contents, and annotations.
We achieve this conformance of datasets in the library through a combination of in-depth investigative curation and ingest processes for already-collected data, and a well-defined user experience that provides a platform for researchers to contribute and organize all of their research data as they are collected.
The following sections provide specific detail on the design and decision-making behind this unifying structure.
%%dg more like a system informed by the pitfalls of committing solely to either extreme.

\section{Data Architecture}

%%dg would a figure illustration be helpful here? do we already have one?
%%dg in general, how much room do we have for screenshots, if they help explain?

As with most user-driven databases, we separate individual data contributions or packages into individual collections variously referred to as datasets, studies, or volumes.
Volumes can be associated with a minimal amount of metadata (title, description, permissions, etc.) as well as additional files (documents and other materials).
These volumes are to some extent embeddable and referenceable, both among themselves and to and from external entities by DOI.
The remainder of this work will address the available structures of data within these volumes, highlighting how these structures allow commonalities between volumes to be represented.

% should we actually use the term "record"?  Alternatives: "grouping", "label", "annotation", ...
% as long as we're clear in defining it. the record section appears to be doing this.

There are two key, innovative structural elements that comprise a volume: the session and the record.
Sessions are the primary container for data files, basically an elaboration on traditional file folders with additional temporal metadata.
Records are used to represent all types of scalar variable-based data, traditionally contained in flat files or databases, as well as to provide an organizational structure among sessions.
The combination of these two elements allows data and metadata to be flexibly related and annotated.

\subsection{The ``Session''}

%dg "The session was designed both to organize videos in a way that is familiar to researchers, as well as to allow them to 'go into' a session and add or edit data." - stuff like this to remind the reader why we're discussing these components in specific (rather than some other aspect of the system).
Researchers record activities with individuals either for the purpose of a later, closer review or analysis, or simply to document and verify measurements and observations made during the collection.
Thus, the recording itself is often the core item of research, representing a single data collection, experiment, trial, visit, or case depending on the nature of the research.
However, in many cases a single session can comprise multiple videos: from serial data streams due to recording equipment being producing multiple files, and/or in parallel from multiple data capture sources operating at the same time.
These primary recordings may also be augmented with other forms of timeseries data such as motion capture, eye tracking, or physiological recordings, as well as with additional point-in-time measurements, observations, or surveys, all of which have specific and critical temporal relationships with the primary data.

% should we be using more language like, "we observed", "in practice"?
%%dg - if it helps to illustrate particular points better, sure. 
When working with multiple primary recordings, researchers often reduce these raw files into a single representation.
For example, they may concatenate serial recordings or make a composite video by joining or overlaying frames.
Secondary data is also often overlaid or combined in this way, such as by adding an additional waveform or frequency visualization below a video, or by overlaying crosshairs representing location or gaze data.
Doing so allows for more convenient human analysis of the data in standard tools that only support a single data stream, but also loses some of the raw data, by obscuring, masking, or downsampling spatially or temporally.

Instead, we capture these relationships within an object called a session, which can comprise not only arbitrary files but also their absolute or relative temporal positioning.
The metaphor we use here is a timeline, wherein each session defines a time range, with absolute timestamps representing the exact time of data collection, or relative positioning defined by a 0 starting point of the collection (or potentially any other meaningful wall-time units) with an optional date.
Files placed within a session can then be (optionally) positioned, much as in video or audio editing software.
Although some advanced recording equipment provides automatic timestamping or synchronization than can be used, most researchers collecting multiple parallel data streams use ``sync points'' such as an electronic trigger signal, flash, or tone to align recordings.

\subsubsection{Simple annotations}

Once the timeframe of a session is established, this can allow temporally-positioned annotations to be attached to the session.
% this is sort of an aside:
%%dg maybe the value here is that we've designed things with this specific type of research in mind.
In fact, this practice is very common in research when analyzing recordings, and specialized desktop software tools are employed to review video and audio and annotate events, utterances, actions, or scenes at any temporal scale, from individual samples/frames to the entire session.
Most of these tools currently focus on a single recording file, however, and despite the plethora of tools and features, there is little interoperability.

In addition to providing an organizational structure that allows users to visualize data in ways familiar to their research, we also currently allow keyword-based tagging and comment-based discussions on any temporal segment of a session.
These annotations could be applied manually by users or by automated video analysis systems.
We expect that these annotations will provide an index target for additional discovery capabilities for users looking for particular features within data.

%%dg, i guess it's crucial to make the audience aware that one of the specific challenges for us is that we're not just storing comprehensive single video files, but multiple files that capture the same phenomenon and how do we keep all those together in a meaningful way...to differentiate us from being "just another you tube".

\subsection{The ``Record''}

%%dg maybe add some langauge to the beginning of this section that is explicit that the "record" is designed with the flexibility we talk about above in mind.
An object called a record serves a number of purposes around session and metadata organization. 
A record itself represents any number of variables or measurements---what would traditionally be a row of a database or flat file.
For example, a record may represent an individual participant within the dataset and contain their subject identifier, gender, birthdate, and any other demographic, survey, or measurement data about that participant.
A record could also represent a particular experimental task, condition, location, or outcome, and contain variables with corresponding parameters or descriptions.
Records are thus labeled and divided by the type of entity they represent.
The variables themselves are textual, numeric, date, or potentially any other scalar data as in any traditional tabular data interface, with the records of a given type constituting the tabular rows.

Records can also be used to organize sessions.
We observed that different researchers organize their data files in different ways according to the type of research.
Many consider participants to be the primary item of analysis, and so create a directory for each participant.
Others organize their data based on date, experimental condition, phase of analysis, or age groups.
Sometimes even single video files are split up into segments according to scene or activity, and researchers consider this property the primary organizational principal.

Rather than trying to handle all of these strategies separately, we instead leverage records.
That is, records can be attached to sessions, or, equivalently, sessions can be grouped into records, in a many-to-many relationship.
For example, in a traditional psychology study, each participant may appear in exactly one session, so the collected information about that participant, added to the record, is attached one-to-one with their session.
A dataset may also be composed of a few different sub-sets based on experimental procedures or location, and here each session would be placed into exactly one of these few records.
In some research, multiple participants may also appear in multiple sessions, such as recordings of the same class of students over a span of time.

Since researchers can create whichever record types apply to their data, they can then choose to group their data by whichever record type they wish.
This also allows users to either import or export data in what they consider the native directory structure by indicating the appropriate nesting of record types.
By providing some standardization of record types, we can also perform broad, meta-searches across the library, for example for all videos containing participants of a particular age range.

Finally, records can be attached not only to entire sessions, but also to arbitrary temporal sub-sets of a session.
That is, if any record only applies to part of a session, for example a single activity, or a participant being present for only part of a recording, it can be applied within the timeline of a session to only the appropriate part.
This allows the final type of organizational structure, wherein records define virtual sub-sessions that can be grouped and interacted with as units, without needing to cut up source videos.
It also can be used to represent annotations at a finer temporal scale, for example individual events interactions that are normally handled by off-line annotation softaware.
However, the appropriate interfaces and tools to input or import these annotations are still being developed.

%\subsection{Technical infrastructure}

%%dg other notes: should we give a bit more discussion of the infrastruction - Postgresql, ffmpeg, using HPC for transcoding, storage, frontend technologies etc. 
% i'm not sure. do other papers have this sort of "methods" section? -dylan
%%dg - other papers in this general area (see: Peer_2012, Griffin_etal_2014, and Witt_2012 from references) do comment on the technology used (if there actually is a product and not just a proposed framework) to varying degrees. I don't think we have to spend more than a paragraph on it, but it would be good to mention the stack in terms of taking, augmenting, and storing video files and metadata overall.

\section{Standardization vs. Flexibility}

As the extant research data libraries demonstrate, there is always the tension between standardization and flexibility.
Since we're primarily dealing with video and audio data, we have, without much loss of flexibility, standardized on a particular encoding format (codecs and parameters) that allows for convenient access and HTML5-based streaming, while still allowing arbitrary resolutions and sample/frame-rates.
We also allow for ``dumps'', which allow users - using certain portable data formats (e.g. ...) - to include any data that cannot be encompassed by our standard formats. In this way, we can incorporate data which may be relevant for re-use, but not broadly adopted by the community, without making the system too rigid.

Here we have also introduced a number of metadata concepts where this tension becomes most apparent, namely the available record types, variables (and values within categorical data types), and tag keywords.
We have adopted an approach of encouraging adherence to existing standardized options but also allowing new types to be created as the data require it.
We encourage standardization both on-line as data are collected and entered via our user interface using auto-completion, suggestions, and drop-down options, and off-line via manual review and curation of contributed data.

Achieving the appropriate balance will no doubt be challenging, but by limiting our focus to particular research domains we have been able to achieve a good amount of standardization across the entire data library without overly burdening contributors.

%%dg not sure if this drives us off course, but wondering how much we should discuss library specific challenges in the "stuff to come section", both pertaining to video data and just in general, largely stuff that we will still have to deal with, such as: 1) creation and organization of metadata is still largely manual and time consuming - both in combing videos for stuff to clip out and also trying to extract more metadata from the contributed data itself as well as third party sources (e.g. keywords from journals). 2) interpretation of data lends to this, we can't always rely on contributors to be available to tell us what we need to know about their data 3) metadata interoperability: DOIs; Export in friendly formats (Dublin Core, METS), OAI-PMH compliance.
