Limited amount of space for contributors - "up to 100 gb project space...10 gb data storage...for 10 years". Collections can be deaccessioned after expiration. This is largely around storage of files and their metadata. Metadata -> Dublin Core -> OAI-PMH -> Library Catalog. Purdue part of the founding members of Datacite and DOI. "The (PURR) working group used the Trust-worthy Repository Audit Checklist (TRAC) as a guiding document in their design of PURR". Largely this is about what libraries can do to support researchers with the knowledge they already have and this new tool.}

Abstract = {In January of 2011, the National Science Foundation began requiring that all proposals for research funding include data management plans. At the time of the mandate, Purdue University's library and campus information technology units had been collaborating on enhancements to the HUBzero virtual research environment. These efforts were parlayed into the development of an institutional, digital data repository and service with the support of the campus research office. In the process, local library science practices have been extended to facilitate research data curation and cyberinfrastructure on campus. Librarians are consulting on data management plans, conducting data reference and instruction, advising on data organization and description, and stewarding collections of data within an evolving library service framework.

Abstract = {The two pillars of the modern scientific communication are Data Centers and Research Digital Libraries (RDLs), whose technologies and admin staff support researchers at storing, curating, sharing, and discovering the data and the publications they produce. Being realized to maintain and give access to the results of complementary phases of the scientific research process, such systems are poorly integrated with one another and generally do not rely on the strengths of the other. Today, such a gap hampers achieving the objectives of the modern scientific communication, that is, publishing, interlinking, and discovery of all outcomes of the research process, from the experimental and observational datasets to the final paper. In this work, we envision that instrumental to bridge the gap is the construction of “Scientific Communication Infrastructures”. The main goal of these infrastructures is to facilitate interoperability between Data Centers and RDLs and to provide services that simp},

@article{Griffin_etal_2014,
Abstract = {A prototype Digital Video Library was developed as part of a project to assist rural primary care clinics with diagnosis of autism, funded by the National Network of Libraries of Medicine. The Digital Video Library takes play sample videos generated by a rural clinic and makes it available to experts at the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) Clinic at The University of Alabama. The experts are able to annotate segments of the video using an integrated version of the Childhood Autism Ratings Scale-Second Edition Standard Version (CARS2). The Digital Video Library then extracts the annotated segments, and provides a robust search and browse feature. The videos can then be accessed by the subject's primary care physician. This article summarizes the development and features of the Digital Video Library. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@COMMENT{Value of this paper is in the fact that "...there is currently not enough conceptual research of interactive video retrieval from a user-centered perspective, which contrasts with other areas of information retrieval research where the interaction process has been thoroughly examined for a variety of domains and contexts with implications for different retrieval tools like OPACs, search engines, and article databases." Largely insights into designing search and browse functionality into the user experience of a video library. Has a lit review. Probably only informative for the "upcoming problems"section. Good for references and undergirding the fact that this is a largely unexplored space (as opposed to text media search and retrieval in a library context)}

Abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a framework applicable to interactive video retrieval. The objective of the framework is so that it can be applied conceptually for understanding users and use of video digital libraries, and also practically for designing retrieval components like user interfaces. Design/methodology/approach – The framework was developed through a user-centered and analytical approach, and serves as an initial attempt at generalizing how users interact when searching and browsing digital video, throughout different situations, along with the general designs that can be supportive. Findings – The framework is two-fold, yet, together, comprises one set of conceptual findings. The first component of the framework depicts generalized user interactions throughout varying contexts of an interactive video retrieval process, followed by a second component, an illustration of the resulting supportive interface designs or sets of features.

@article{Macmillan_2014,
Abstract = {Drawing from the literatures of science, scholarly communication, and librarianship, this review paper describes what librarians need to know about how scientists manage and share their data. It is intended to help librarians become more engaged and integral partners in research and education. Scientific data repositories, journal data deposition policies, and the development of persistent linking between scholarly publications and data sets, have made data more accessible. However, deposition and sharing practices still vary among researchers, journal publishers, data repositories, information providers, and universities. Understanding the dynamic relationships between these stakeholders is critical to providing relevant support to researchers and students in the sciences.

@article{Lyle_2014,
Abstract = {The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) was founded over 50 years ago "to further the development of research in political science" (Miller 1963:11). Since that summer of 1962, the scope and range of services ICPSR offers has expanded significantly to encompass the wider social and behavioral research community, and from a handful of data collections to thousands. With over 750 consortial members from around the world, ICPSR is now a leader in preserving, curating, and providing access to scientific data so others can reuse the data and validate research findings. Much of the success of ICPSR can be traced back to the consortial model upon which the organization was founded, with members providing funding, input, and a sense of community. This article describes the history and current status of the consortium, and discusses upcoming challenges and opportunities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Abstract = {Broadly speaking, the lack of a framework for organizing, preserving, and making research data available for the long term has resulted in valuable datasets becoming lost or discarded. The approach of the Distributed Data Curation Center of the Purdue University Libraries has been to integrate librarians and the principles of library and archival sciences with domain sciences, computer and information sciences, and information technology to address the challenges of managing collections of research data and to learn how to better support interdisciplinary research through data curation. One piece of infrastructure that supports these activities is a "distributed institutional repository" that includes electronic documents, digitized archival collections, and research datasets housed in multiple systems that are connected together using Web Services and other middle- ware. Concurrently, roles for librarians and institutional repositories in data curation are being explored. [ABSTRACT F},

Abstract = {Technology usage is changing rapidly and is becoming a more mobile, more social and more multimedia-based experience. This is especially true in the area of content creation where mobile social applications used by crowds of people are challenging traditional ways of creating and distributing content, especially for applications like news dissemination. Libraries have traditionally functioned as repositories where the information content of a society is analysed, curated, organised and stored, acting as a permanent record of what is to be remembered from a society. How can this function be achieved by present-day libraries attempting to cope with mobile, social, multimedia content who's nature and utility of which change the type of information we wish to curate and store? This information is both dynamic and organic, posing challenges to the more fixed models of information in digital libraries.

abstract={We describe the design, implementation, and deployment of the Comprehensive Extensible Data Documentation and Access Repository (CED2AR). This is a metadata repository system that allows researchers to search, browse, access, and cite confidential data and metadata through either a web-based user interface or programmatically through a search API, all the while re-reusing and linking to existing archive and provider generated metadata. CED2AR is distinguished from other metadata repository-based applications due to requirements that derive from its social science context. These include the need to cloak confidential data and metadata and manage complex provenance chains.},

@COMMENT{Using Dryad as an example of metadata best practices in research data repositories. good for referencing comments about how metadata is important for a repository, but expensive and non-trivial to collect and ensure the quality of. shores up what good metadata ought to be in a system like a data repository.}
@article{Greenberg_etal_2009,
Abstract = {Digital data repositories ought to support immediate operational needs and long-term project goals. This paper presents the Dryad repository's metadata best practice balancing of these two needs. The paper reviews background work exploring the meaning of science, characterizing data, and highlighting data curation metadata challenges. The Dryad repository is introduced, and the initiative's metadata best practice and underlying rationales are described. Dryad's metadata approach includes two prongs: one addressing the long-term goal to align with the Semantic Web via a metadata application profile; and another addressing the immediate need to make content available in DSpace via an extensible markup language (XML) schema. The conclusion summarizes limitations and advantages of the two prongs underlying Dryad's metadata effort. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@COMMENT{good for any lingering discussion on the larger challenges faced in research data management (inro, conclusion type stuff)}
@article{Pinfield_etal_2014,
Abstract = {The management of research data is now a major challenge for research organisations. Vast quantities of born-digital data are being produced in a wide variety of forms at a rapid rate in universities. This paper analyses the contribution of academic libraries to research data management (RDM) in the wider institutional context. In particular it: examines the roles and relationships involved in RDM, identifies the main components of an RDM programme, evaluates the major drivers for RDM activities, and analyses the key factors influencing the shape of RDM developments. The study is written from the perspective of library professionals, analysing data from 26 semi-structured interviews of library staff from different UK institutions. This is an early qualitative contribution to the topic complementing existing quantitative and case study approaches. Results show that although libraries are playing a significant role in RDM, there is uncertainty and variation in the relationship with othe},

@article{Farooq_etal_2007,
Abstract = {Social bookmarking services have recently gained popularity among Web users. Whereas numerous studies provide a historical account of tagging systems, the authors use their analysis of a domain-specific social bookmarking service called CiteULike to reflect on two metrics for evaluating tagging behavior: tag growth and tag reuse. They examine the relationship between these two metrics and articulate design implications for enhancing social bookmarking services. The authors briefly reflect on their own work developing a social bookmarking service for CiteSeer. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

title={Automatic Tag Recommendation for Metadata Annotation Using Probabilistic Topic Modeling},
year={2013},

pages={239--248},
abstract={The increase of the complexity and advancement in ecological and environmental sciences encourages scientists across the world to collect data from multiple places, times, and thematic scales to verify their hypotheses. Accumulated over time, such data not only increases in amount, but also in the diversity of the data sources spread around the world.  This poses a huge challenge for scientists who have to manually search for information. To alleviate such problems, ONEMercury has recently been implemented as part of the DataONE project to serve as a portal for accessing environmental and observational data across the globe. ONEMercury harvests metadata from the data hosted by multiple repositories and makes it searchable. However, harvested metadata records sometimes are poorly annotated or lacking meaningful keywords, which could affect effective retrieval. Here, we develop algorithms for automatic annotation of metadata. We transform the problem into a tag recommendation problem with a controlled tag library, and propose two variants of an algorithm for recommending tags.  Our experiments on four datasets of environmental science metadata records not only show great promises on the performance of our method, but also shed light on the different natures of the datasets.}
